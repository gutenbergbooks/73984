<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">“W</span>E are as near Heaven by sea as by land,” cried Sir
Humphrey Gilbert, ere his ship sank with him; and
the hundreds who perished in the ocean within reach
of the exultant welcome and the festal preparation of the shore
have found Paradise as surely, and in giving “the last full
measure of devotion” have gone as brave men would wish to go.</p>

<p>Sorrow that is too deep and strong for words clutches the
heart-strings of humanity and the Nation mourns for the heroic
dead, who were carried down into the sea with the crushed
“Titanic.” They faced death with high hearts, making the
Supreme Sacrifice so that the women and the helpless little ones
might live.</p>

<p>It is a heart-rending story, redeemed and ennobled by the
heroism of the victims. Its details are appalling. The world is
full of mournings for the dead. Nature has conquered again,
destroying with ruthless hand the most marvelous ship that ever
floated on the bosom of the deep.</p>

<p>It is the worst disaster that ever befell any vessel. It is the
wrecking of a whole armada within one hull of steel, vaunted as
unsinkable.</p>

<p>The sinking of the “Titanic” is an appalling catastrophe, in
the contemplation of which any words that can be uttered are
as futile as in the presence of the awful majesty of the Angel
of Death.</p>

<p>The maiden trip of the newest, staunchest and greatest of the
modern ocean greyhounds has thus apparently ended in the most
appalling marine disaster ever recorded.</p>

<p>The first advices brought word of the safe removal of all the
passengers and the possible success of the crew in their endeavor
to bring the noblest ship afloat to shallow water. Another triumph
of the wireless telegraph was hailed, and from both shores went up
a paean of thanksgiving that the overwhelming loss was not of
life but of things material, that, however valuable, are far less dear
and can one day be replaced.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_iv">{iv}</a></span></p>

<p>But now as a bolt from the blue, and as a forecast of the final
mortal terrors of the Day of Judgment, comes the message that of
2300 souls aboard, but 700&mdash;chiefly women and children&mdash;have
been saved.</p>

<p>All earthly concerns beside this calamity seem to fade into
littleness and nothingness. The sole redeeming circumstance is
that heroes met their death like men, and that human love was
victorious over human terror, and mightier than Death and the
open grave of the remorseless deep.</p>

<p>The one alleviating circumstance in this terrible tragedy is
the fact that the men stood aside and insisted that the women and
children should first have places in the boats.</p>

<p>There were men who were accustomed merely to pronounce
a wish to have it gratified. For one of the humblest fishing
smacks or a dory they could have given the price that was paid to
build the immense ship that has become the most imposing mausoleum
that ever housed the bones of men since the Pyramids rose
from the desert sands.</p>

<p>But these men stood aside&mdash;one can see them&mdash;and gave
place not merely to the delicate and the refined, but to the
scared woman from the steerage with her toddler by her side,
coming through the very gate of Death and out of the mouth of
Hell to the imagined Eden of America.</p>

<p>To many of those who went it was harder to go than to stay
there on the vessel gaping with its mortal wounds and ready to go
down. It meant that tossing on the waters they must wait in suspense,
hour after hour, even after the lights of the ship were
engulfed in appalling darkness, hoping against hope for the
miracle of a rescue dearer to them than their own lives.</p>

<p>It was the tradition of Anglo-Saxon heroism that was fulfilled
in the frozen seas during the black hours of the night. The
heroism was that of the women who went, as well as of the men
who remained.</p>

<p>The sympathy of all the world will go out to the stricken
survivors of the victims of a world-wide calamity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_v">{v}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="nind">
<span class="letra">
<img src="images/ill_t.png"

height="160"
alt="T"></span>HE human imagination is unequal to the reconstruction
of the appalling scene of the disaster in the
North Atlantic. No picture of the pen or of the
painter’s brush can adequately represent the magnitude
of the calamity that has made the whole
world kin.</p>

<p>How trivial in such an hour seem the ordinary
affairs of civilized mankind&mdash;the minor ramifications
of politics, the frenetic rivalry of candidates,
the haggle of stock speculators. We are suddenly,
by an awful visitation, made to see our human transactions in
their true perspective, as small as they really are.</p>

<p>Man’s pride is profoundly humbled: he must confess that the
victory this time has gone to the blind, inexorable forces of nature,
except in so far as the manifestation of the heroic virtues is concerned.</p>

<p>The ship that went to her final resting place two miles below
the placid, unconfessing level of the sea represented all that science
and art knew how to contribute to the expedition of traffic, to the
comfort and enjoyment of voyagers.</p>

<p>She had 15 watertight steel compartments supposed to render
her unsinkable. She was possessed of submarine signals with microphones,
to tell the bridge by means of wires when shore or ship or
any other object was at hand.</p>

<p>There was a collision bulkhead to safeguard the ship against
the invasion of water amidships should the bow be torn away. In
a word, the boat was as safe and sound as the shipbuilder could
make it.</p>

<p>It was the pride of the owners and the commander that what
has happened could not possibly occur. And yet the Titanic went
down, and carried to their doom hundreds of passengers and men
who intimately knew the sea and had faced every peril that the navigator
meets.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_vi">{vi}</a></span></p>

<p>In the hours between half-past 10 on Sunday night and half-past
2 Monday morning, while the ship still floated, what did the
luxuries of their $10,000,000 castle on the ocean avail those who
trod the eight steel decks, not knowing at what moment the whole
glittering fabric might plunge with them&mdash;as it did plunge&mdash;to the
unplumbed abyss below?</p>

<p>What was it, in those agonizing hours, to the men who remained
aboard, or to the women and children placed in the boats, that there
were three electric elevators, squash courts and Turkish baths, a hospital
with an operating room, private promenade decks and Renaissance
cabins? What is it to a man about to die to know that there
is at hand a palm garden or a darkroom for photography, or the
tapestry of an English castle or a dinner service of 10,000 pieces of
silver and gold?</p>

<p>In that midnight crisis the one thing needful was not provided,
where everything was supplied. The one inadequacy was&mdash;the lack
of lifeboats.</p>

<p>In the supreme confidence of the tacit assumption that they
never would be needed, the means of rescue&mdash;except in a pitiably
meagre insufficiency&mdash;was not at hand. There were apparently but
20 boats and rafts available, each capable of sustaining at most 60
persons.</p>

<p>Yet the ship was built to carry 2435 passengers and 860 in the
crew&mdash;a total of 3295 persons.</p>

<p>Whatever the luxuriousness of the appointments, the magnificence
of the carvings and the paintings that surfeited the eye,
the amplitude of the space allotted for the promenade, it seems incredible
no calculation was made for the rescue of at least 2000 of
the possible floating population of the Titanic.</p>

<p>The result of the tragedy must be that aroused public opinion
will compel the formulation of new and drastic regulations, alike by
the British Board of Trade and by the Federal authorities, providing
not merely for the adequate equipment of every ship with salvatory
apparatus but for rigorous periodical inspection of the appliances
and a constant drill of the crew.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_vii">{vii}</a></span></p>

<p>Let there be an end of boasting about the supremacy of man
to the immitigable laws and forces of nature. Let the grief of mankind
be assuaged not in idle lamentation but in amelioration of the
conditions that brought about the saddest episode in the history of
ships at sea.</p>

<p>The particular line that owned and sent forth the vessel that
has perished has been no more to blame than others that similarly
ignored elemental precautions in favor of superfluous comforts, in a
false sense of security.</p>

<p>When the last boatload of priceless human life swung away
from the davits of the Titanic, it left behind on the decks of the
doomed ship hundreds of men who knew that the vessel’s mortal
wound spelt Death for them also. But no cravens these men who
went to their nameless graves, nor scourged as the galley slave to his
dungeon.</p>

<p>Called suddenly from the ordinary pleasure of ship life and
fancied security, they were in a moment confronted with the direct
peril of the sea, and the absolute certainty that, while some could go
to safety, many must remain.</p>

<p>It was the supreme test, for if a man lose his life he loses all.
But, had the grim alternative thought to mock the cowardice of the
breed, it was doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p>Silently these men stood aside. “Women first,” the inexorable
law of the sea, which one disobeys only to court everlasting ignominy,
undoubtedly had no place in their minds. “Women first,”
the common law of humanity, born of chivalry and the nobler spirit
of self-sacrifice, prevailed.</p>

<p>They simply stood aside.</p>

<p>The first blush of poignant grief will pass from those who survive
and were bereft. But always will they sense in its fullest
meaning this greatest of all sacrifice. Ever must it remain as a reassuring
knowledge of the love, and faithfulness, and courage, of
the Man, and of his care for the weak.</p>

<p>“Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his
life for his friend.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span>”</p>

<h2><a id="HUNDREDS_WEEP_AT_MEMORIAL_SERVICES_HELD"></a>HUNDREDS WEEP AT MEMORIAL SERVICES HELD<br>
FOR “ARCHIE” BUTT.</h2>

<p>Fifteen hundred sincere mourners for Major Archibald W.
Butt, lost on the Titanic, wept unashamed at his home in Augusta,
Georgia, on May 2, when President Taft called his former aid
affectionately by his first name and choked with tears as he paid a
personal tribute to the army officer.</p>

<p>It was at a monster memorial service for the soldier, where
all Augusta paid homage to his memory. President Taft was the
main speaker. He was deeply affected by the solemn ritual.</p>

<p>“If Archie could have selected a time to die he would have
chosen the one God gave him,” the President said, his voice
broken with emotion.</p>

<p>“His life was spent in self-sacrifice, serving others. His forgetfulness
of self had become a part of his nature.</p>

<p>“Everybody who knew him called him Archie.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t prepare anything in advance to say here,” the
President continued. “I tried, but couldn’t. He was too near me.
He was loyal to my predecessor, Mr. Roosevelt, who selected him
to be military aid, and to me he had become as a son or a brother.”</p>

<p>Taft pictured a new side to Major Butt’s character&mdash;his love
for his mother.</p>

<p>“I think he never married because of that love for her who
was taken from him two years ago,” the President declared.</p>

FROM A DAY OF DELIGHT TO DEATH.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">April 14, 1912, a Fateful Date&mdash;Lulled to False Security&mdash;Peaceful
Sabbath Ends in Dire Disaster&mdash;Hopes Sink Beneath
the Cruel and Treacherous Waves of the Atlantic&mdash;Man’s
Proudest Craft Crumbles Like an Eggshell.</p></div>

<p>The hands of the ship’s clock pointed to 11.40. The beautiful
day of April 14, 1912, rapidly was drawing to its close.</p>

<p>A solemn hush brooded over the ocean, the stillness broken
only by the swish of the waters as they protested against being
so rudely brushed aside by the mammoth creation of man. Then,
too, the soft cadences of sacred music from the ship’s orchestra
sent their strains dancing o’er the billows to mingle with the
star beam and intensify rather than mar the stillness.</p>

<p>Above, the stars and planets twinkled and glittered as they
beam only in the rarified atmosphere of the far northern latitudes.</p>

<p>The day had been one of rare beauty. A soft and caressing
breeze had kissed the sea and rocked the waves in a harmonious
symphony against the steel-ribbed sides of the world’s largest,
greatest and most luxurious floating palace, the majestic Titanic,
the newest addition to the trans-Atlantic fleet of the White Star
Line of the International Navigation Company.</p>

<p>The star-sprinkled dome of heaven and the phosphorescent
sea alike breathed forth peace, quiet and security.</p>

<p>Despite the lateness of the hour, aboard the Titanic all was
animation. A few, to be sure, had wearied of Nature’s marvels
and had sought their slumber, but the gorgeous quarters of the
first cabin and the scarcely less pretentious sections set apart for
second class passengers were alike teeming with life and light.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_18">{18}</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, as they had for days past, the mighty engines
of this monster of the sea pulsed and throbbed, while the rhythmic
beat of the Titanic’s great bronze-bladed propellors churned
up a fast and steadily lengthening wake behind the speeded
vessel.</p>

<p>“We’ll break the record today,” her officers laughed, and the
passengers gleefully shared their mirth.</p>

<p>A record; a record!</p>

<p>And a record she made&mdash;but of death and destruction!</p>

<p>But who could know? And since no mortal could, why not
eat, drink and be merry?</p>

<p>Britain’s shores had been left behind far back across the
waste of waters. America, the land of hope, was almost in
sight ahead.</p>

<h3>TALK OF HOME AND FRIENDS AND LIFE.</h3>

<p>Small wonder that hundreds still strolled the Titanic’s spotless,
unsullied decks and talked of home and friends and life and
joy and hope. Small wonder that other hundreds lounged at
ease in her luxurious saloons and smoking rooms, while other
scores of voyagers, their appetites whetted by the invigorating
air, sat at a midnight supper to welcome the new week with a
feast.</p>

<p>Why sleep when the wealth, the beauty, the brains, the aristocracy
as well as the bone and sinew of a nation were all
around one?</p>

<p>For, be it known, never before did ship carry so distinguished
a company&mdash;a passenger list that reads like a Social
Blue Book.</p>

<p>This maiden trip of the Titanic was an event that was to go
down in history, they thought.</p>

<p>And so it will, but with tears on every page of the narrative
and the wails of women and children in every syllable.</p>

<p>But since the future is unrolled only in God’s own good
time, how could they know?</p>

<p>Why wonder at their presence?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_19">{19}</a></span></p>

<p>Was this not the first trip of the greatest triumph of marine
architecture?</p>

<p>Had not the wealth and fashion of two continents so arranged
their plans as to be numbered on its first passenger list?</p>

<p>Had not the hardy immigrant skimped and saved and
schemed that he and his family should be carried to the Land
of Promise aboard this greatest of all ships?</p>

<p>What mattered it to him that his place was in the steerage?
Did not each pulsing throb of the Titanic’s mighty engines bear
him as far and as fast as though he, too, already held in his hand
the millions he felt he was destined to win in this golden land of
opportunity beyond the seas?</p>

<p>And so, from the loftiest promenade deck to the lowest stoke
hole in the vitals of the ship peace and comfort and happiness
reigned.</p>

<h3>APPROACHING HOME AND FRIENDS.</h3>

<p>To some the rapidly-nearing shores of America meant home&mdash;and
friends. To others, opportunity&mdash;and work. Yet to all
it meant the culmination of a voyage which, so far, had been one
all-too-short holiday from the bustle and turmoil of a busy world.</p>

<p>“Man proposes, but God disposes!”</p>

<p>Never were truer words uttered, nor phrase more fitting to
that fateful hour.</p>

<p>“In the midst of life we are in death.”</p>

<p>Yet the soft breeze from the south still spread its balmy,
salt-laden odors to delight their senses and to lull them to a feeling
of complete security.</p>

<p>What was that?</p>

<p>A cold breath as from the fastnesses of the Frost King
swept the steamer’s decks.</p>

<p>A shiver of chill drove the wearied passengers below, but
sent the ship’s officers scurrying to their stations. The seaman,
and the seaman alone, knew that that icy chill portended icebergs&mdash;and
near at hand.</p>

<p>Besides, twice in the last few hours had the wireless ticked<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_20">{20}</a></span>
its warnings from passing vessels that the Titanic was in the
vicinity of immense floes.</p>

<p>Why had the warning not been heeded?</p>

<p>Why had the ponderous engines continued to thunder with
the might of a hundred thousand horses, and the ship to plunge
forward into the night with the unchecked speed of an express
train?</p>

<p>God knows!</p>

<p>The captain knew, but his lips are sealed in death as, a self-inflicted
bullet in his brain, he lies in the cold embrace of the sea
he had loved and had defied&mdash;too long.</p>

<h3>THE LOOKOUT’S WARNING CRY.</h3>

<p>Perhaps Bruce Ismay, the managing director of the line,
who was on board&mdash;and survived when women drowned&mdash;also
knows. Perhaps he will tell by whose orders those danger warnings
were scoffed at and ignored.</p>

<p>Perhaps; perhaps!</p>

<p>The lookout uttered a sharp cry!</p>

<p>Too late!</p>

<p>One grinding crash and the Titanic had received its death
blow. Man’s proudest craft crumbled like an eggshell.</p>

<p>Ripped from stem to engine room by the great mass of ice
she struck amidships, the Titanic’s side was laid open as if by a
gigantic can opener. She quickly listed to starboard and a
shower of ice fell on to the forecastle deck.</p>

<p>Shortly before she sank she broke in two abaft the engine
room, and as she disappeared beneath the water the expulsion of
air or her boilers caused two explosions, which were plainly
heard by the survivors adrift.</p>

<p>A moment more and the Titanic had gone to her doom with
the fated hundreds grouped on the after deck. To the survivors
they were visible to the last, and their cries and moans were
pitiable.</p>

<p>The one alleviating circumstance in the otherwise unmitigable
tragedy is the fact that the men stood aside and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_21">{21}</a></span>sisted
that the women and the children should first have places
in the boats.</p>

<p>There were men whose word of command swayed boards of
directors, governed institutions, disposed of millions. They
were accustomed merely to pronounce a wish to have it gratified.</p>

<p>Thousands “posted at their bidding;” the complexion of the
market altered hue when they nodded; they bought what they
wanted, and for one of the humblest fishing smacks or a dory
they could have given the price that was paid to build and launch
the ship that has become the most imposing mausoleum that
ever housed the bones of men since the Pyramids rose from the
desert sands.</p>

<p>But these men stood aside&mdash;one can see them&mdash;and gave
place not merely to the delicate and the refined, but to the scared
Czech woman from the steerage, with her baby at her breast;
the Croatian with a toddler by her side, coming through the very
gate of Death and out of the mouth of Hell to the imagined Eden
of America.</p>

<h3>HARDER TO GO THAN TO STAY.</h3>

<p>To many of those who went it was harder to go than to stay
there on the vessel gaping with its mortal wounds and ready to
go down. It meant that tossing on the waters they must wait
in suspense, hour after hour even after the lights of the ship were
engulfed in appalling darkness, hoping against hope for the
miracle of a rescue dearer to them than their own lives.</p>

<p>It was the tradition of Anglo-Saxon heroism that was fulfilled
in the frozen seas during the black hours of that Sunday
night. The heroism was that of the women who went, as well
as of the men who remained.</p>

<p>The most adequate story of the terrible disaster is told by
a trained newspaper man, who was on the Carpathia. He says:</p>

<p>Cause, responsibility and similar questions regarding the
stupendous disaster will be taken up in time by the British
marine authorities. No disposition has been shown by any survivor
to question the courage of the crew, hundreds of whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_22">{22}</a></span>
saved others and gave their own lives with a heroism which
equaled, but could not exceed, that of John Jacob Astor, Henry
B. Harris, Jacques Futrelle and others in the long list of the first
cabin missing.</p>

<p>Facts which I have established by inquiries on the Carpathia,
as positively as they could be established in view of the
silence of the few surviving officers, are:</p>

<p>That the Titanic’s officers knew, several hours before the
crash, of the possible nearness of icebergs.</p>

<p>That the Titanic’s speed, nearly twenty-three knots an hour,
was not slackened.</p>

<h3>INSUFFICIENT LIFE-BOATS.</h3>

<p>That the number of lifeboats on the Titanic was insufficient
to accommodate much more than one-third of the passengers, to
say nothing of the crew. Most members of the crew say there
were sixteen lifeboats and two collapsibles; none say there were
more than twenty boats in all. The 700 who escaped filled most
of the sixteen lifeboats and the one collapsible which got away,
to the limit of their capacity.</p>

<p>That the “women first” rule, in some cases, was applied to
the extent of turning back men who were with their families,
even though not enough women to fill the boats were at hand on
that particular part of the deck. Some few boats were thus
lowered without being completely filled, but most of these were
soon filled with sailors and stewards, picked up out of the water,
who helped man them.</p>

<p>That the bulkhead system, though probably working in the
manner intended, availed only to delay the ship’s sinking. The
position and length of the ship’s wound (on the starboard quarter)
admitted icy water, which caused the boilers to explode, and
these explosions practically broke the ship in two.</p>

<p>Had the ship struck the iceberg head-on, at whatever speed,
and with whatever resultant shock, the bulkhead system of
water-tight compartments would probably have saved the vessel.
As one man expressed it, it was the “impossible” that happened<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_23">{23}</a></span>
when, with a shock unbelievably mild, the ship’s side was torn
for a length which made the bulkhead system ineffective.</p>

<p>The Titanic was 1799 miles from Queenstown and 1191 miles
from New York, speeding for a maiden voyage record. The
night was starlight, the sea glassy. Lights were out in most of
the staterooms and only two or three congenial groups remained
in the public rooms.</p>

<p>In the crows’ nest, or lookout, and on the bridge, officers
and members of the crew were at their places, awaiting relief
at midnight from their two hours’ watch.</p>

<p>At 11.45 came the sudden sound of two gongs, a warning
of immediate danger.</p>

<p>The crash against the iceberg, which had been sighted at
only a quarter of a mile, came almost simultaneously with the
clink of the levers operated by those on the bridge, which stopped
the engine and closed the watertight doors.</p>

<h3>CAPTAIN SMITH ON THE BRIDGE.</h3>

<p>Captain Smith was on the bridge a moment later, giving
orders for the summoning of all on board and for the putting
on of life preservers and the lowering of the lifeboats.</p>

<p>The first boats lowered contained more men passengers
than the latter ones, as the men were on deck first, and not
enough women were there to fill them.</p>

<p>When, a moment later, the rush of frightened women and
crying children to the deck began, enforcement of the women-first
rule became rigid. Officers loading some of the boats drew
revolvers, but in most cases the men, both passengers and crew,
behaved in a way that called for no such restraint.</p>

<p>Revolver shots, heard by many persons shortly before the
end of the Titanic caused many rumors. One was that Captain
Smith shot himself, another was that First Officer Murdock
ended his life. Smith, Murdock and Sixth Officer Moody are
known to have been lost. The surviving officers, Lightoller,
Pitman, Boxhall and Lowe, have made no statement.</p>

<p>Members of the crew discredit all reports of suicide, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_24">{24}</a></span>
say Captain Smith remained on the bridge until just before the
ship sank, leaping only after those on the decks had been washed
away. It is also related that, when a cook later sought to pull
him aboard a lifeboat, he exclaimed, “Let me go!” and, jerking
away, went down.</p>

<p>What became of the men with life preservers? is a question
asked since the disaster by many persons. The preservers did
their work of supporting their wearers in the water until the ship
went down. Many of those drawn into the vortex, despite the
preservers, did not come up again. Dead bodies floated on the
surface as the last boats moved away.</p>

<h3>“NEARER MY GOD TO THEE.”</h3>

<p>To relate that the ship’s string band gathered in the saloon,
near the end, and played “Nearer, My God, To Thee,” sounds
like an attempt to give an added solemn color to a scene which
was in itself the climax of solemnity. But various passengers
and survivors of the crew agree in the declaration that they heard
this music. To some of the hearers, with husbands among the
dying men in the water, and at the ship’s rail, the strain brought
in thought the words</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“So, by my woes I’ll be<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nearer, My God, to Thee,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nearer to Thee.”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“Women and children first,” was the order in the filling of
the Titanic’s lifeboats. How well that order was fulfilled, the
list of missing first and second cabin passengers bears eloquent
witness. “Mr.” is before almost every name, and the contrast
is but made stronger by the presence of a few names of women&mdash;Mrs.
Isidor Straus, who chose death rather than to leave her
husband’s side; Mrs. Allison, who remained below with her husband
and daughter, and others who, in various ways, were kept
from entering the line of those to be saved.</p>

<p>To most of the passengers, the midnight crash against the
ice mountain did not seem of terrific force. Many were so little
disturbed by it that they hesitated to dress and put on life pre<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_25">{25}</a></span>servers,
even when summoned by that thundering knocks and
shouts of the stewards. Bridge players in the smoking room
kept on with their game.</p>

<p>Once on deck, many hesitated to enter the swinging lifeboats.
The glassy sea, the starlit sky, the absence, in the first
few moments, of intense excitement, gave them the feeling that
there was only some slight mishap&mdash;that those who got into the
boats would have a chilly half-hour below, and might later be
laughed at.</p>

<p>It was such a feeling as this, from all accounts, which caused
John Jacob Astor and his wife to refuse the places offered them
in the first boat, and to retire to the gymnasium. In the same
way, H. J. Allison, Montreal banker, laughed at the warning,
and his wife, reassured by him, took her time about dressing.
They and their daughter did not reach the Carpathia. Their
son, less than two years old, was carried into a lifeboat by his
nurse, and was taken in charge by Major Arthur Peuchen.</p>

<h3>ADMIRATION AND CONFIDENCE.</h3>

<p>The admiration felt by passengers and crew for the matchlessly
appointed vessel was translated, in those first few moments,
into a confidence which for some proved deadly.</p>

<p>In the loading of the first boat restrictions of sex were not
made, and it seemed to the men who piled in beside the women
that there would be boats enough for all. But the ship’s officers
knew better than this, and as the spreading fear caused an earnest
advance toward the suspended craft, the order, “Women
first!” was heard, and the men were pushed aside.</p>

<p>To the scenes of the next two hours on those decks and in
the waters below, such adjectives as “dramatic” and “tragic” do
but poor justice. With the knowledge of deadly peril gaining
greater power each moment over those men and women, the
nobility of the greater part, both among cabin passengers, officers,
crew and steerage, asserted itself.</p>

<p>Isidor Straus, supporting his wife on her way to a lifeboat,
was held back by an inexorable guard. Another officer strove<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_26">{26}</a></span>
to help her to a seat of safety, but she brushed away his arm and
clung to her husband, crying, “I will not go without you.”</p>

<p>Another woman took her place, and her form, clinging to
her husband’s, became part of a picture now drawn indelibly in
many minds. Neither wife nor husband reached a place of
safety.</p>

<p>Colonel Astor, holding his young wife’s arm, stood decorously
aside as the officers spoke to him, and Mrs. Astor and her
maid were ushered to seats. Mrs. Henry B. Harris, parted in
like manner from her husband, saw him last at the rail, beside
Colonel Astor. Walter M. Clark, of Los Angeles, nephew of the
Montana Senator, joined the line of men as his young wife, sobbing,
was placed in one of the boats.</p>

<h3>AN AGONIZING SEPARATION.</h3>

<p>“Let him come! There is room!” cried Mrs. Emil Taussig
as the men of the White Star Line motioned to her husband to
leave her. It was with difficulty that he released her hold to
permit her to be led to her place.</p>

<p>George D. Widener, who had been in Captain Smith’s company
a few moments after the crash, was another whose wife was
parted from him and lowered a moment later to the surface of
the calm sea.</p>

<p>Of Major Archie Butt, a favorite with his fellow tourists;
of Charles M. Hayes, president of the Grand Trunk; of Benjamin
Guggenheim and of William T. Stead, no one seems to
know whether they tarried too long in their staterooms or
whether they forebore to approach the fast filling boats, none of
them was in the throng which, weary hours afterward, reached
the Carpathia.</p>

<p>Simultaneously on all the upper decks of the ship the ropes
creaked with the lowering of the boats. As they reached the
water, those in the boats saw what those on the decks could not
see&mdash;that the Titanic was listing rapidly to starboard, and that
her stern was rising at a portentous angle. A rush of steerage<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_27">{27}</a></span>
men toward the boats was checked by officers with revolvers in
hand.</p>

<p>Some of the boats, crowded too full to give rowers a chance,
drifted for a time. None had provisions or water; there was
lack of covering from the icy air, and the only lights were the
still undimmed arcs and incandescents of the settling ship, save
for one of the first boats. There a steward, who explained to
the passengers that he had been shipwrecked twice before, appeared
carrying three oranges and a green light.</p>

<p>That green light, many of the survivors say, was to the
shipwrecked hundreds as the pillar of fire by night. Long after
the ship had disappeared, and while confusing false lights danced
about the boats, the green lantern kept them together on the
course which led them to the Carpathia.</p>

<h3>ECHOING SPLASH OF CHILLY WATERS.</h3>

<p>As the end of the Titanic became manifestly but a matter of
moments, the oarsmen pulled their boats away, and the chilling
waters began to echo splash after splash as the passengers and
sailors in life preservers leaped over and started swimming away
to escape the expected suction.</p>

<p>Only the hardiest of constitutions could endure for more
than a few moments such a numbing bath. The first vigorous
strokes gave way to the heart-breaking cries of “Help! Help!”
and stiffened forms were seen floating, the faces relaxed in death.</p>

<p>Revolver shots were heard in the ship’s last moments. The
first report spread among the boats was that Captain Smith had
ended his life with a bullet. Then it was said that a mate had
shot a steward who tried to push his way upon a boat against
orders. None of these tales has been verified, and many of the
crew say the captain, without a preserver, leaped in at the last
and went down, refusing a cook’s offered aid.</p>

<p>The last of the boats, a collapsible, was launched too late
to get away, and was overturned by the ship’s sinking. Some
of those in it&mdash;all, say some witnesses&mdash;found safety on a raft
or were picked up by lifeboats.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_28">{28}</a></span></p>

<p>In the Marconi tower, almost to the last, the loud click of
the sending instrument was heard over the waters. Who was
receiving the message, those in the boats did not know, and they
would least of all have supposed that a Mediterranean ship in
the distant South Atlantic track would be their rescuer.</p>

<p>As the screams in the water multiplied, another sound was
heard, strong and clear at first, then fainter in the distance. It
was the melody of the hymn “Nearer, My God, to Thee,” played
by the string orchestra in the dining saloon. Some of those on
the water started to sing the words, but grew silent as they realized
that for the men who played the music was a sacrament
soon to be consummated by death. The serene strains of the
hymn and the frantic cries of the dying blended in a symphony
of sorrow.</p>

<h3>BOATS FOLLOW THE GREEN LIGHT.</h3>

<p>Led by the green light, under the light of the stars, the boats
drew away, and the bow, then the quarter, then the stacks and
at last the stern of the marvel-ship of a few days before passed
beneath the waters. The great force of the ship’s sinking was
unaided by any violence of the elements, and the suction, into so
great as had been feared, rocked but mildly the group of boats
now a quarter of a mile distant from it.</p>

<p>Sixteen boats were in the forlorn procession which entered
on the terrible hours of rowing, drifting and suspense. Women
wept for lost husbands and sons. Sailors sobbed for the ship
which had been their pride. Men chocked back tears and sought
to comfort the widowed. Perhaps, they said, other boats might
have put off in another direction toward the last. They strove,
though none too sure themselves, to convince the women of the
certainty that a rescue ship would appear.</p>

<p>Early dawn brought no ship, but not long after 5 A. M. the
Carpathia, far out of her path and making eighteen knots, instead
of her wonted fifteen, showed her single red and black
smokestack upon the horizon. In the joy of that moment, the
heaviest griefs were forgotten.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_29">{29}</a></span></p>

<p>Soon afterward Captain Rostrom and Chief Steward
Hughes were welcoming the chilled and bedraggled arrivals over
the Carpathia’s side.</p>

<p>Terrible as were the San Francisco, Slocum and Iroquois
disasters, they shrink to local events in comparison with this
world-catastrophe.</p>

<p>True, there were others of greater qualifications and longer
experience than I nearer the tragedy&mdash;but they, by every token
of likelihood, have become a part of the tragedy. The honored&mdash;must
I say lamented&mdash;Stead, the adroit Jacques Futrelle, what
might they not tell were their hands able to hold pencil?</p>

<p>The silence of the Carpathia’s engines, the piercing cold,
the clamor of many voices in the companionways, caused me to
dress hurriedly and awaken my wife at 5.40 A. M. Monday. Our
stewardess, meeting me outside, pointed to a wailing host in the
rear dining room and said, “From the Titanic. She’s at the
bottom of the ocean.”</p>

<h3>THE LAST OF THE LINE OF BOATS.</h3>

<p>At the ship’s side, a moment later, I saw the last of the line
of boats discharge their loads, and saw women, some with cheap
shawls about their heads, some with the costliest of fur cloaks,
ascending the ship’s side. And such joy as the first sight of our
ship may have given them had disappeared from their faces, and
there were tears and signs of faltering as the women were helped
up the ladders or hoisted aboard in swings. For lack of room to
put them, several of the Titanic’s boats after unloading were set
adrift.</p>

<p>At our north was a broad icefield, the length of hundreds of
Carpathias. Around us on other sides were sharp and glistening
peaks. One black berg, seen about 10 A. M., was said to be that
which sunk the Titanic.</p>

<p>In his tiny house over the second cabin smoking room was
Harold Cotton, the Marconi operator, a ruddy English youth,
whose work at his post, on what seemed ordinary duty, until al<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_30">{30}</a></span>most
midnight, had probably saved the lives of the huddling
hundreds below.</p>

<p>Already he was knitting his brows over the problem of
handling the messages which were coming in batches from the
purser’s office. The haste with which these Marconigrams were
prepared by their senders was needless, in view of the wait of
two days and two nights for a long connection. “Safe” was the
word with which most of the messages began; then, in many of
them, came the words “&mdash;&mdash; missing.”</p>

<p>Dishevelled women, who the night before could have drawn
thousands from husbands’ letters of credit or from Titanic’s
safe, stood penniless before the Carpathia’s purser, asking that
their messages be forwarded&mdash;collect. Their messages were
taken with the rest.</p>

<h3>HOPE REVIVED BY SIGHT OF CATTLE BOAT.</h3>

<p>The Californian, a cattle ship, came near us, and though it
gave no sign of having any of the Titanic’s refugees on board,
its presence in the vicinity gave hope to many women who were
encouraged in the belief that the Californian might have picked
up their loved ones.</p>

<p>Captain Rostrom’s decision to abandon the Mediterranean
course, begun the Thursday before, and to return to an American
port, was soon known to the passengers. At first it was
reported that Halifax or Boston would be the destination, but
at noon the notice of the intended arrival at New York three
days later was posted. At that time the Carpathia, at an increase
over her usual moderate speed, was westward bound and
her passengers were deferring their hopes of Gibraltar, Naples
and Trieste, and were sharing their rooms with the newcomers.
Few men of the Carpathia’s passenger list slept in a bed in any
of the nights that followed. They had the men of the Titanic
lay in chairs on deck, on dining tables or smoking-room couches,
or on the floors of the rooms which held their hand baggage and
their curtained-off guests. The captain was the first to vacate
his room, which was used as a hospital.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_31">{31}</a></span></p>

<p>In the first cabin library, women of wealth and refinement
mingled their grief and asked eagerly for news of the possible
arrival of a belated boat, or a message from some other steamer
telling of the safety of their husbands. Mrs. Henry B. Harris,
wife of a New York theatrical manager, checked her tears long
enough to beg that some message of hope be sent to her father-in-law.
Mrs. Ella Thor, Miss Marie Young, Mrs. Emil Taussig
and her daughter, Ruth; Mrs. Martin Rothschild, Mrs. William
Augustus Spencer, Mrs. J. Stuart White and Mrs. Walter M.
Clark were a few of those who lay back, exhausted, on the
leather cushions and told in shuttering sentences of their experiences.</p>

<h3>PROUD OF HER HUSBAND’S OARSMANSHIP.</h3>

<p>Mrs. John Jacob Astor and the Countess of Rothes had been
taken to staterooms soon after their arrival on shipboard.
Those who talked with Mrs. Astor said she spoke often of her
husband’s ability as an oarsman and said he could save himself
if he had a chance. That he could have had such a chance, she
seemed hardly to hope.</p>

<p>To another stateroom a tall, dark man had been conducted,
his head bowed, anguish in his face. He was Bruce Ismay, head
of the International Mercantile Marine and chief owner of the
Titanic and her sister ship, the Olympic. He has made the
maiden voyage on each of his company’s great ships. He remained
in his room in a physician’s care during the voyage back
to New York. Captain Rostrom, his only caller, was not admitted
to see him until Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>Before noon, at the captain’s request, the first cabin passengers
of the Titanic gathered in the saloon, and the passengers
of other classes in corresponding places on the rescue ship.
Then the collecting of names was begun by the purser and the
stewards. A second table was served in both cabins for the
new guests, and the Carpathia’s second cabin, being better fitted
than its first, the second class arrivals had to be sent to the
steerage.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_32">{32}</a></span></p>

<p>In the middle of the morning, the Carpathia passed near the
spot, seamen said, where the Titanic went down. Only a few
floating chairs marked the place. The ice peaks had changed
their position. Which of those in sight, if any, caused the wreck
was matter of conjecture.</p>

<p>Those of the refugees who had not lost relatives found subject
for distress in the reflection that their money and jewels
were at the bottom of the sea. Miss Edith L. Rosenbaum, writer
for a fashion trade journal, mourned the loss of trunks containing
robes from Paris and Tunis. Several of the late works of
Philip Mock, miniature painter, were in his lost baggage, but the
artist was not inclined to dwell on this mishap.</p>

<h3>AN OBJECT OF PITYING SIGHS.</h3>

<p>The child of the Montreal Allisons, bereft of both parents
and carried by a nurse, was an object of pitying sighs in the
saloon. In the second cabin, two French children engaged pitying
attention. The two boys, four and two years old, who had
lost their mother a year before and their father the night before,
were children of beauty and intelligence, but were too abashed
to answer any questions, even those put in their native tongue.
Their surname is believed to be Hoffman. They are now in
the care of Miss Margaret Hays, of 304 West Eighty-third
street, New York.</p>

<p>Reminiscences of two bridge whist games of Sunday night
in the smoking-room and the lounge room were exchanged by
passengers who believed that the protracted games, a violation
of the strict Sabbath rules of English vessels, saved their lives.
Alfred Drachenstadt was leader in the smoking-room game, Miss
Dorothy Gibson in the other.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jacques Futrelle, wife of the novelist, herself a writer
of note, sat dry-eyed in the saloon, telling her friends that she
had given up hope for her husband. She joined with the rest in
inquiries as to the chances of rescue by another ship, and no
one told her what soon came to be the fixed opinion of the men&mdash;that
all those saved were on the Carpathia.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_33">{33}</a></span></p>

<p>“I feel better,” Mrs. Futrelle said hours afterward, “for I
can cry now.”</p>

<p>Among the men, conversation centred on the accident and
the responsibility for it. Many expressed the belief that the
Titanic, in common with other vessels, had had warning of the
ice packs, but that in the effort to establish a record on the
maiden run sufficient heed had not been paid to the warnings.
The failure of the safety compartments, said to have been closed
from the bridge directly after the accident, was the occasion of
amazement, and one theory offered was that the doors had, for
some reason, not closed in the usual manner. Others contended
that these devices are, at best, but time-savers, and said that
without them the Titanic would have gone under before three
boats could have been lowered.</p>

<h3>THE OFFICERS’ REQUIREMENTS DISCUSSED.</h3>

<p>The requirement that the officers on the bridge should take
temperatures of the water every fifteen minutes to indicate the
approach of ice was also discussed.</p>

<p>As to the behavior of officers and crew, not a word of complaint
was heard from the men. They were praised as worthy
Britons and true seamen. In the same breath the survivors
exalted the heroism of the missing men of the first cabin, who
had stood calmly waiting for their turn&mdash;the turn which, because
of scarcity of boats and shortness of time, never came for most
of them.</p>

<p>“God knows I’m not proud to be here!” said a rich New
York man. “I got on a boat when they were about to lower
it and when, from delays below, there was no woman to take
the vacant place. I don’t think any man who was saved is deserving
of censure, but I realize that, in contrast with those who
went down, we may be viewed unfavorably.” He showed a
picture of his baby boy as he spoke.</p>

<p>As the day passed, the fore part of the ship assumed some
degree of order and comfort, but the crowded second cabin and
decks gave forth the incessant sound of lamentation. A bride<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_34">{34}</a></span>
of two months sat on the floor and moaned her widowhood. An
Italian mother shrieked the name of her lost son.</p>

<p>A girl of seven wept over the loss of her Teddy Bear and
two dolls, while her mother, with streaming eyes, dared not tell
the child that her father was lost, too, and that the money for
which their home in England had been sold had gone down
with him. Other children clung to the necks of the fathers
who, because carrying them, had been permitted to take the
boats.</p>

<p>At 4 P. M. Monday the service for the dead was read by
Father Roger Anderson, of the Episcopal Order of the Holy
Cross, over the bodies of three seamen and one man, said to
have been a cabin passenger, who were dead from exposure
when received on this ship. Some of the Titanic’s passengers
turned away from the rail as the first of the weighted forms fell
into the water.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br><br>
HEART-RENDING SCENES ON CARPATHIA.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">The Next Day&mdash;Caring for the Sick&mdash;Meeting of the Survivors&mdash;Personal
Wireless Messages Given Precedence&mdash;Marconi’s
Appeal Fruitless&mdash;Quartermaster Tells Story.</p></div>

<p>The writer’s narrative continues:</p>

<p>In the hospital and the public rooms lay, in blankets, several
others who had been benumbed by the water. Mrs. Rosa Abbott,
who was in the water for hours, was restored during the
day. G. Wikeman, the Titanic’s barber, who declared he was
blown off the ship by the second of the two explosions after the
crash, was treated for bruises. A passenger, who was thoroughly
ducked before being picked up, caused much amusement
on this ship, soon after the doctors were through with him, by
demanding a bath.</p>

<p>Storekeeper Prentice, the last man off the Titanic to reach
this ship, was also soon over the effects of his long swim in the
icy waters, into which he leaped from the poop deck.</p>

<p>The physicians of the Carpathia were praised, as was Chief
Steward Hughes, for work done in making the arrivals comfortable
and averting serious illness.</p>

<p>Monday night on the Carpathia was one of rest. The wailing
and sobbing of the day were hushed as the widows and
orphans slept. Tuesday, save for the crowded condition of the
ship, matters took somewhat their normal appearance.</p>

<p>Tuesday afternoon, in the saloon, a meeting of survivors
was held and plans for a testimonial to the officers and crew of
the Carpathia and the survivors of the Titanic’s crew were discussed.
It was decided that relief of the destitute should first
be considered, and the chairman of the meeting, Samuel Goldenberg,
appointed a committee consisting of I. G. Frauenthal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_36">{36}</a></span>
Mrs. J. J. Brown, William Bushnell and George Stone to raise
a fund. The first subscriptions were for $100 each, and the
amounts were paid largely in travelers’ checks or personal
checks, cash being somewhat scarce among the refugees, who
had kept their currency in the purser’s safe.</p>

<p>Resolutions were adopted praising the Titanic’s surviving
officers and crew and the officers, crew and passengers of the
Carpathia, and declaring that a memorial is needed for “those
who in heroic self-sacrifice made possible the rescue of so many
others.” One speaker suggested that a memorial fund be raised
by popular subscription, mentioning the “World” as a suitable
medium. This and other suggestions were left to the committee
to develop.</p>

<p>Rain and fog marked the Carpathia’s homeward course, and
those who were not seasick when New York was reached were
none the less sick of the sea.</p>

<h3>CAPTAIN ROSTROM’S RULE.</h3>

<p>Captain Rostrom’s rule that personal messages should take
precedence of press messages was not relaxed, even when Tuesday
a message from Guglielm Marconi himself asked the reason
why press dispatches were not sent. The captain posted Marconi’s
message on the bulletin board, and beside it a bulletin
stating that no press messages, except a bulletin to the Associated
Press, had been sent. The implication was that none
would be sent, and the most urgent and respectful appeals failed
to change his determination, which, he seemed convinced, was
in the best interest of the survivors and their friends.</p>

<p>My wife was my only active helper in a task which ten
newspaper men could not have performed completely. Mr. S.
V. Silverthorne, of St. Louis, aided greatly by lending me his
first cabin passenger list, one of the few in existence.</p>

<p>Robert Hichens, one of the surviving quartermasters of the
Titanic, the man who was on duty at the wheel when the ship
struck the iceberg, told me the tale of the wreck on the Carpathia
Thursday.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_37">{37}</a></span></p>

<p>Save for the surviving fourth officer, Boxhall, whose lips
are sealed, Hichens saw Sunday night’s tragedy at closer range
than any man now living.</p>

<p>In the hastily compiled list of surviving members of the
crew, the names of Hichens and other quartermasters appear
among the able-bodied seamen; but the star and anchor on the
left sleeve of each distinguishes them in rank from the A. B.’s.</p>

<p>Hichens has followed the sea fifteen years and has a wife
and two children in Southampton. His tale of the wreck, as
he told it to me and as he expects to tell it to a Marine Court of
Inquiry, is here given:</p>

<p>“I went on watch at eight o’clock Sunday night and stood
by the man at the wheel until ten. At ten I took the wheel for
two hours.</p>

<p>“On the bridge from ten o’clock on were First Officer Murdock,
Fourth Officer Boxhall and Sixth Officer Moody. In the
crow’s nest (lookout tower) were Fleet and another man whose
name I don’t know.</p>

<h3>SECOND OFFICER ON WATCH.</h3>

<p>“Second Officer Lightoller, who was on watch while I
stood by, carrying messages and the like, from eight to ten, sent
me soon after eight to tell the carpenter to look out for the fresh
water supply, as it might be in danger of freezing. The temperature
was then 31 degrees. He gave the crow’s nest a strict
order to look out for small icebergs.</p>

<p>“Second Officer Lightoller was relieved by First Officer
Murdock at ten, and I took the wheel then. At 11.40 three gongs
sounded from the crow’s nest, the signal for ‘something right
ahead.’</p>

<p>“At the same time one of the men in the nest telephoned to
the bridge that there was a large iceberg right ahead. As Officer
Murdoch’s hand was on the lever to stop the engines the
crash came. He stopped the engines, then immediately by another
lever closed the water-tight doors.</p>

<p>“The skipper (Captain Smith) came from the chart room on<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_38">{38}</a></span>
to the bridge. His first words were ‘Close the emergency doors.’</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>They’re already closed, sir,’ Mr. Murdock replied.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Send to the carpenter and tell him to sound the ship,’ was
the skipper’s next order. The message was sent to the carpenter.
The carpenter never came up to report. He was probably
the first man on that ship to lose his life.</p>

<br>
<div class="caption"><p>COLUMBIA AND BRITANNIA MOURN FOR THE “TITANIC’S” DEAD.</div>
</div>

<p>“The skipper looked at the commutator, which shows in
what direction the ship is listing. He saw that she carried five
degrees list to the starboard.</p>

<p>“The ship was then rapidly settling forward. All the steam
sirens were blowing. By the skipper’s orders, given in the next
few minutes, the engines were put to work at pumping out the
ship, distress signals were sent by Marconi and rockets were sent<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_39">{39}</a></span>
up from the bridge by Quartermaster Rowe. All hands were ordered
on deck and life belts were sewed to the crew and to every
passenger.</p>

<p>“The stewards and other hands helped the sailors in getting
the boats out. The order ‘women and children first’ was given
and enforced. There was no panic.</p>

<p>“I was at the wheel until 12.25. It was my duty to stay
there until relieved. I was not relieved by anyone else, but was
simply sent away by Second Officer Lightoller, who told me to
take charge of a certain boat and load it with ladies.</p>

<p>“I did so, and there were thirty-two ladies, a sailor and myself
in the boat when it was lowered, some time after 1 o’clock&mdash;I
can’t be sure of the time.</p>

<h3>ALL BOATS BUT ONE GET AWAY SAFELY.</h3>

<p>“The Titanic had sixteen lifeboats and two collapsible boats.
All of them got away loaded, except that one of the collapsibles
did not open properly and was used as a raft. Forty sailors and
stewards who were floating in the water, got on this raft, and
later had to abandon the raft, and were picked up by the different
boats. Some others were floating about on chairs when
picked up.</p>

<p>“Every boat, so far as I saw, was full when it was lowered,
and every boat that set out reached the Carpathia. The green
light on one of the boats helped to keep us together, but there
were other lights. One was an electric flashlight that a gentleman
had carried in his pocket.</p>

<p>“Our boat was 400 yards away when the ship went down.
The suction nearby must have been terrific, but we were only
rocked somewhat.</p>

<p>“I have told only what I know, and what I shall tell any
marine court that may examine me.”</p>

<p>G. Whiteman, of Palmyra, N. J., the Titanic’s barber, was
lowering boats on deck A, after the collision, and declares the
officers on the bridge, one of them Second Officer Murdock,
promptly worked the electrical apparatus for closing the water-<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_40">{40}</a></span>tight
compartments. He believes the machinery was in some
way so damaged by the crash that the front compartments failed
to close tightly, although the rear ones were secure.</p>

<p>Whiteman’s manner of escape was unique. He was blown
off the deck by the second of the two explosions of the boilers,
and was in the water more than two hours before he was picked
up by a raft.</p>

<p>“The explosions,” Whiteman said, “were caused by the
rushing in of the icy water on the boilers. A bundle of deck
chairs, roped together, was blown off the deck with me, and
struck my back, injuring my spine, but it served as a temporary
raft.</p>

<p>“The crew and passengers had faith in the bulkhead system
to save the ship, and we were lowering a Benthon collapsible
boat, all confident the ship would get through, when she took a
terrific dip forward and the water rushed up and swept over the
deck and into the engine rooms.</p>

<h3>BLOWN FIFTEEN FEET.</h3>

<p>“The bow went clean down, and I caught the pile of chairs
as I was washed up against the rail. Then came the explosions
and blew me fifteen feet.</p>

<p>“After the water had filled the forward compartments the
ones at the stern could not save her. They did delay the ship’s
going down. If it wasn’t for the compartments hardly any one
could have got away.</p>

<p>“The water was too cold for me to swim and I was hardly
more than one hundred feet away when the ship went down. The
suction was not what one would expect and only rocked the
water around me. I was picked up after two hours. I have done
with the sea.”</p>

<p>Whiteman was one of those who heard the ship’s string
band playing “Nearer, My God, to Thee” a few moments before
she went down.</p>

<p>R. Norris Williams, a Philadelphia youth on his way home
from England to take the Harvard entrance examinations, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_41">{41}</a></span>
one of the few saloon passengers at the rail excluded by the women-first
order from the boats who was saved. His father, Duane
Williams, was lost.</p>

<p>“There is much, and yet there is little, to tell of my experience,”
said young Williams. “My father and I had about
given up our hope for life and were standing together, resolved
to jump together and keep together if we could, so long as either
of us lived. I had on my fur coat.</p>

<p>“The forward end, where we stood, was sinking rapidly,
and before we could jump together the water washed my father
over. Then, with the explosions, the ship seemed to break in
two, and the forward end bounded up again for an instant. I
leaped, but with dozens in the water between us my father was
lost to me.</p>

<h3>SWAM AND DRIFTED NEARLY TWO HOURS.</h3>

<p>“I swam and drifted nearly two hours before I was pulled
aboard the raft or collapsible boat which served for a time as
a raft. Later, with the abandonment of the raft, I was taken
aboard a boat.”</p>

<p>Frederic K. Seward, who sat next to W. T. Stead at the
Titanic’s saloon table, told of the veteran English journalist’s
plans for his American visit. His immediate purpose was to aid
in the New York campaign of the Men and Religion Forward
Movement.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stead talked much of spiritualism, thought transference
and the occult,” said Seward. “He told a story of a mummy case
in the British Museum which, he said, had had amazing adventures,
but which punished with great calamities any person who
wrote its story. He told of one person after another who, he
said, had come to grief after writing the story, and added that,
although he knew it, he would never write it. He did not say
whether ill-luck attached to the mere telling of it.”</p>

<p>Stead also told, Seward said, of a strange adventure of a
young woman with an admirer in an English railroad coach,
which was known to him as it happened, and which he afterward<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_42">{42}</a></span>
repeated to the young woman, amazing her by repeating everything
correctly save for one small detail.</p>

<p>Had Harold Cotton, Marconi operator on the Carpathia,
gone to bed Sunday night at his usual time, the Carpathia would
have known nothing of the Titanic’s plight, and the lifeboats,
without food or water, might have been the scenes of even greater
tragedy than the great death ship itself.</p>

<p>The Carpathia, an easy going Mediterranean ship, has only
one Marconi man, and when Cotton had not the receiver on his
head the ship was out of communication with the world.</p>

<p>Cotton, an Englishman of twenty-one years, told me the
morning after the wreck how he came to receive the Titanic’s
C Q D.</p>

<h3>JUST ABOUT TO TURN IN WHEN CALLED BY C. Q. D.</h3>

<p>“I was relaying a message to the Titanic Sunday night,
shortly after 11 o’clock by my time,” he said, “and told Phillips,
the Titanic’s Marconi man, that I had been doing quite a bit of
work for him, and that if he had nothing else for me I would
quit and turn in for the night. Just as I was about to take the
receiver off my head came ‘C Q D.’ This was followed with
‘We’ve hit something. Come at once.’</p>

<p>“I called a sailor and sent word to an officer, and a few
minutes later the Captain turned the Carpathia, at eighteen
knots, in the direction of the Titanic, which was sixty miles or
more from us.</p>

<p>“Before I could tell the Titanic we were coming, came their
‘S O S,’ and the operator added ‘I’m afraid we’re gone.’ I told
him we were coming, and he went on sending out signals in
every direction.”</p>

<p>An assistant Marconi man from the Titanic, not on duty at
the time of the wreck, was among the survivors and assisted Cotton
in his work after Wednesday, having been laid up the two
previous days by the shock of the chill he suffered in the water
and by injuries to his legs.</p>

<p>He denied a report, generally circulated on this ship, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_43">{43}</a></span>
Jack Binns, of Republic fame, was on the Titanic. He said
Phillips, the Titanic’s chief operator, was lost.</p>

<p>Mrs. Edward S. Robert, whose husband, a leading St. Louis
attorney, died last December during her absence in England, and
her daughter, Miss Georgette Madill, have been in close seclusion
on the Carpathia since their rescue from the Titanic. They are
accompanied by Mrs. Robert’s maid.</p>

<p>S. V. Silverthorne, buyer for Nugent’s, was one of three or
four saloon passengers on the Titanic who saw the deadly iceberg
just after the collision.</p>

<p>“I was in the smoking room reading near a bridge whist
game at one of the tables,” he said, “when the crash came. I
said, ‘We’ve hit something,’ and went out on the starboard side
to look. None of us was alarmed. It occurred to me that we
might have bumped a whale, or at most, ran down some small
craft.</p>

<h3>ORDERED ON DECK AND TOLD TO GET INTO THE BOATS.</h3>

<p>“I went back in the smoking room with the others. One of
the bridge players had not left the smoking room at all and was
waiting impatiently for the others to come back and resume the
game. They returned and took up their hands and we were all
about to settle down, when an officer ordered us on deck and told
us to get into the boats, there not being enough women on deck
to fill the first ones. We didn’t like the idea of leaving the ship
then, but did as we were told. Had we been in our rooms we
would have had to stand aside, as other men did then.”</p>

<p>Two orphan French boys, about two and four years old respectively,
whose sur-name is believed to be Hoffman and who
called each other Louis and Lolo, will be cared for by Miss Margaret
Hays, of 304 W. 83d st., New York, while efforts will be
made to find their relatives, to whom their father was thought
to have been taking them. The elder boy has been ill with a
fever for three days, the excitement, exposure and probably grief
over the loss of his father having told on the little fellow. The
other, too young to realize what has befallen him, played around<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_44">{44}</a></span>
the saloon or sat contentedly in the lap of one of his new made
but devoted friends among the passengers.</p>

<p>The father, who is in the list of second cabin passengers as
“Mr. Hoffman,” is said to have told fellow-passengers on the
Titanic the children’s mother died recently.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sylvia Caldwell, of Bangkok, Siam, is happy in having
her husband and little son. Since she was the last woman to embark,
her husband was able to come with her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Esther Hart, whose husband was lost, was coming,
with their daughter Eva, to visit Mr. Hart’s sister in New York,
then to go on to Winnipeg to make their home. They had sold
the property at Ilford, Essex, England. All their money was lost
when Mr. Hart went down with the Titanic.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lucy Ridsdale, of London, had said good-by to England
and had started for Marietta, O., to make her home with her
sisters. She was saved with the few clothes she wore. She had
written letters telling of a “safe arrival and pleasant voyage” and
had them ready to mail. They went down with the ship.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_45">{45}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br><br>
BAND PLAYED TO THE LAST.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">Suffering in the Lifeboats&mdash;Statement by Ismay&mdash;Would not
Desert Husband&mdash;Thirty on Raft in Icy Water&mdash;Colonel
Astor a Hero&mdash;Joked Over Collision&mdash;Officer Saves Many
Lives.</p></div>

<p>But another account, compiled from various sources among
the survivors gives somewhat varying angles and supplies quite
a few missing details.</p>

<p>At the risk of a few slight repetitions it is given:</p>

<p>Of the great facts that stand out from the chaotic accounts
of the tragedy, these are the most salient:</p>

<p>The death list was increased rather than decreased. Six
persons died after being rescued.</p>

<p>The list of prominent persons lost stood as at first reported.</p>

<p>Practically every woman and child, with the exception of
those women who refused to leave their husbands, were saved.
Among these last was Mrs. Isidor Straus.</p>

<p>The survivors in the lifeboats saw the lights on the stricken
vessel glimmer to the last, heard her band playing and saw the
doomed hundreds on her deck and heard their groans and cries
when the vessel sank.</p>

<p>Accounts vary as to the extent of the disorder on board.</p>

<p>Not only was the Titanic tearing through the April night to
her doom with every ounce of steam crowded on, but she was under
orders from the general officers of the line to make all the
speed of which she was capable.</p>

<p>This was the statement made by J. H. Moody, a quartermaster
of the vessel and helmsman on the night of the disaster.
He said the ship was making 21 knots an hour, and the officers
were striving to live up to the orders to smash the records.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_46">{46}</a></span></p>

<p>“It was close to midnight,” said Moody, “and I was on the
bridge with the second officer, who was in command. Suddenly
he shouted ‘Port your helm!’ I did so, but it was too late. We
struck the submerged portion of the berg.”</p>

<p>“Of the many accounts given by the passengers most of
them agreed that the shock when the Titanic struck the iceberg,
although ripping her great sides like a giant can opener, did not
greatly jar the entire vessel, for the blow was a glancing one
along her side. The accounts also agree substantially that when
the passengers were taken off on the lifeboats there was no serious
panic and that many wished ‘to remain on board the Titanic,
believing her to be unsinkable.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<h3>EXPERIENCES OF PASSENGERS IN LIFE-BOATS.</h3>

<p>The most distressing stories are those giving the experiences
of the passengers in lifeboats. These tell not only of their own
suffering, but give the harrowing details of how they saw the
great hulk of the Titanic stand on end, stern uppermost for many
minutes before plunging to the bottom. As this spectacle was
witnessed by the groups of survivors in the boats, they plainly
saw many of those whom they had just left behind leaping from
the decks into the water.</p>

<p>J. Bruce Ismay, president of the International Mercantile
Marine, owners of the White Star Line, who was among the
seventy odd men saved; P. A. S. Franklin, vice president of the
White Star Line, and United States Senator William Alden
Smith, chairman of the Senate Investigating Committee, held a
conference aboard the Carpathia soon after the passengers had
come ashore.</p>

<p>After nearly an hour, Senator Smith came out of the cabin
and said he had no authority to subpena witnesses at this time,
but would begin an investigation into the cause of the loss of the
Titanic at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel the next day. He announced
that Mr. Ismay had consented to appear at the hearing, and
that Mr. Franklin and the four surviving officers of the Titanic
would appear for examination by the Senate committee. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_47">{47}</a></span>
said the course the investigation would follow would be determined
after the preliminary hearing.</p>

<p>Senator Smith was questioned as to the speed the Titanic
was proceeding at when she crashed into the iceberg. He said
he had asked Mr. Ismay, but declined to say what Mr. Ismay’s
reply was.</p>

<p>Bruce Ismay, chairman of the International Mercantile Marine,
gave out the following prepared statement on the pier:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/i_047.jpg">
<img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="311" height="217" alt="[The image is unavailable.]"></a>
<br>
<div class="caption"><p>CHART OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC, SHOWING WHERE THE
GREAT LINER “TITANIC” WENT DOWN.</div>
</div>

<p>“In the presence and under the shadows of a catastrophe so
overwhelming my feelings are too deep for expression in words,
and I can only say that the White Star Line officers and employes
will do everything humanly possible to alleviate the suffering
and sorrow of the relatives and friends of those who perished.
The Titanic was the last word in shipbuilding. Every regulation
prescribed by the British Board of Trade had been strictly
complied with. The master, officers and crew were the most experienced
and skillful in the British service.</p>

<p>“I am informed that a committee of the United States<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_48">{48}</a></span>
Senate has been appointed to investigate the circumstances of
the accident. I heartily welcome the most complete and exhaustive
inquiry, and any aid that I can render is at the service of the
public and of the Governments of both the United States and
Great Britain. Under these circumstances I must defer making
any further statement at this hour.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ismay said informally before giving out his statement
that he left the ship in one of the last boats, one of the collapsible
boats on the port side. This statement, however, as will later
appear, is scathingly denounced by several survivors as untrue.</p>

<p>“I do not know the speed at which the Titanic was going,”
said Mr. Ismay in reply to a question. “She hit the iceberg a
glancing blow.”</p>

<h3>MR. ISMAY WILL MAKE A COMPLETE STATEMENT.</h3>

<p>Mr. Ismay, after his interview with Senator Smith, said that
he was desirous of sailing on the Carpathia the next afternoon.
The Carpathia was scheduled to sail at 4 o’clock. Mr. Ismay assured
the Senators, however, that he would make a complete
statement of the catastrophe, and that if he could not finish in
time for the sailing he would change his plans.</p>

<p>Mr. Ismay then went to his apartments at the Ritz-Carlton.</p>

<p>The arrival of the Carpathia brought a vast multitude of
people to the Cunard docks. They filled the vast pier sheds, and,
overflowing for blocks, crowded the nearby streets in a dense
throng. Through it all the rain fell steadily, adding a funeral
aspect to the scene. The landing of the survivors was attended
with little excitement, the crowd standing in awe-like silence as
the groups from the ship passed along. The docking actually
began shortly after nine o’clock and the debarking of passengers
was so quickly disposed of by the waiving of the usual formality
that practically everything had been concluded by 10.30 o’clock.
The crowds remained about the pier long after this, however,
to get a glimpse of the rescuing steamer and to hear the harrowing
stories which had been brought back by the ship.</p>

<p>Colonel Archibald Gracie, U. S. A., the last man saved,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_49">{49}</a></span>
went down with the vessel, but was picked up. He was met by
his daughter, who had arrived from Washington, and his son-in-law,
Paul H. Fabricius. Colonel Gracie told a remarkable story
of personal hardship and denied emphatically the reports that
there had been any panic on board. He praised in the highest
terms the behavior of both the passengers and crew and paid a
high tribute to the heroism of the women passengers.</p>

<p>Contrary to the general expectation, there was no jarring
impact when the vessel struck, according to the army officer. He
was in his berth when the vessel smashed into the submerged
portion of the berg and was aroused by the jar. He looked at his
watch, he said and found it was just midnight. The ship sank
with him at 2.22 A. M. for his watch stopped at that hour.</p>

<h3>WOULD NOT DESERT HER HUSBAND.</h3>

<p>“Mrs. Isidor Straus,” he said, “went to her death because she
would not desert her husband. Although he pleaded with her to
take her place in the boat, she steadfastly refused, and when the
ship settled at the head the two were engulfed by the wave that
swept her.”</p>

<p>Colonel Gracie told of how he was driven to the topmost
deck when the ship settled and was the sole survivor after the
wave that swept her just before her final plunge.</p>

<p>“I jumped with the wave,” said he, “just as I have often
jumped with the breakers at the seashore. By great good fortune
I managed to grasp the brass railing on the deck above, and
I hung on by might and main. When the ship plunged down I
was forced to let go and I was swirled around and around for
what seemed to be an interminable time. Eventually I came to
the surface, to find the sea a mass of tangled wreckage.</p>

<p>“Luckily I was unhurt and, casting about, managed to seize
a wooden grating floating nearby. When I had recovered my
breath I discovered a larger canvas and cork lifecraft which had
floated up. A man, whose name I did not learn, was struggling
toward it from some wreckage to which he had clung. I cast off
and helped him to get on to the raft and we then began the work<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_50">{50}</a></span>
of rescuing those who had jumped into the sea and were floundering
in the water.</p>

<p>“When dawn broke there were thirty of us on the raft,
standing knee deep in the icy water and afraid to move lest the
cranky craft be overturned. Several unfortunately, benumbed
and half dead, besought us to save them and one or two made
an effort to reach us.</p>

<p>“The hours that elapsed before we were picked up by the
Carpathia were the longest and most terrible that I ever spent.
Practically without any sensation of feeling, because of the icy
water, we were almost dropping from fatigue. We were afraid
to turn around to look to see whether we were seen by passing
craft, and when some one who was facing astern passed the word
that something that looked like a steamer was coming up one
of the men became hysterical under the strain. The rest of us, too,
were nearing the breaking point.”</p>

<h3>DENIES THAT ANY MEN WERE FIRED UPON.</h3>

<p>Colonel Gracie denied with emphasis that any men were
fired upon, and declared that only once was a revolver discharged.</p>

<p>“This was for the purpose of intimidating some steerage
passengers,” he said, “who had tumbled into a boat before it was
prepared for launching. This shot was fired in the air, and when
the foreigners were told that the next would be directed at them
they promptly returned to the deck. There was no confusion
and no panic.”</p>

<p>“Before I retired,” said Colonel Gracie, “I had a long chat
with Charles H. Hays, president of the Grand Trunk Railroad.
One of the last things Mr. Hays said was this: ‘The White Star,
the Cunard and the Hamburg-American lines are devoting their
attention and ingenuity in vieing with the other to attain the
supremacy in luxurious ships and in making speed records. The
time will soon come when this will be checked by some appalling
disaster.’ Poor fellow, a few hours later he was dead.”</p>

<p>“The conduct of Colonel Jacob Astor was deserving of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_51">{51}</a></span>
highest praise,” Colonel Gracie declared. “The millionaire New
Yorker,” he said, “devoted all his energies to saving his young
bride, nee Miss Force, of New York, who was in delicate health.</p>

<p>“Colonel Astor helped us in our efforts to get her in the
boat,” said Colonel Gracie. “I lifted her into the boat, and as she
took her place Colonel Astor requested permission of the officer
to go with her for her own protection.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>No, sir,’ replied the officer, ‘not a man shall go on a boat
until the women are all off.’ Colonel Astor then inquired the
number of the boat, which was being lowered away, and turned
to the work of clearing the other boats and in reassuring the
frightened and nervous women.</p>

<p>“By this time the ship began to list frightfully to port. This
became so dangerous that the second officer ordered every one
to rush to starboard. This we did, and we found the crew trying
to get a boat off in that quarter. Here I saw that last of John B.
Thayer and George B. Widener, of Philadelphia.”</p>

<h3>SPEED KEPT UP DESPITE WARNINGS.</h3>

<p>Colonel Gracie said that, despite the warnings of icebergs,
no slowing down of speed was ordered by the commander of the
Titanic. There were other warnings, too, he said. “In the 24
hours’ run ending the 14th,” he said, “the ship’s run was 546
miles, and we were told that the next 24 hours would see even
a better record posted.</p>

<p>“No diminution of speed was indicated in the run and the engines
kept up their steady running. When Sunday evening came
we all noticed the increased cold, which gave plain warning that
the ship was in close proximity to icebergs or icefields. The officers,
I am credibly informed, had been advised by wireless from
other ships of the presence of icebergs and dangerous floes in that
vicinity. The sea was as smooth as glass, and the weather clear
so that it seems that there was no occasion for fear.”</p>

<p>“When the vessel struck,” he continued, “the passengers
were so little alarmed that they joked over the matter. The few
that appeared on deck early had taken their time to dress proper<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_52">{52}</a></span>ly
and there was not the slightest indication of panic. Some of
the fragments of ice had fallen on the deck and these were picked
up and passed around by some of the facetious ones, who offered
them as mementos of the occasion.</p>

<p>“On the port side a glance over the side failed to show any
evidence of damage and the vessel seemed to be on an even
keel. James Clinch Smith and I, however, soon found the vessel
was listing heavily. A few minutes later the officers ordered men
and women to don life preservers.”</p>

<p>E. Z. Taylor, of Philadelphia, one of the survivors, jumped
into the sea just three minutes before the boat sank. He told a
graphic story as he came from the Carpathia.</p>

<p>“I was eating when the boat struck the iceberg,” he said.
“There was an awful shock that made the boat tremble from
stem to stern. I did not realize for some time what had happened.
No one seemed to know the extent of the accident. We
were told that an iceberg had been struck by the ship. I felt
the boat rise, and it seemed to me that she was riding over the
ice.</p>

<h3>ROCKING OVER A VERITABLE SEA OF ICE.</h3>

<p>“I ran out on the deck and then I could see ice. It was a
veritable sea of ice and the boat was rocking over it. I should
say that parts of the iceberg were eighty feet high, but it had
been broken into sections, probably by our ship.</p>

<p>“I jumped into the ocean and was picked up by one of the
boats. I never expected to see land again. I waited on board
the boat until the lights went out. It seemed to me that the
discipline on board was wonderful.”</p>

<p>A young English woman who requested that her name be
omitted told a thrilling story of her experience in one of the collapsible
boats which had been manned by eight of the crew from
the Titanic. The boat was in command of the fifth officer, H.
Lowe, whose actions she described as saving the lives of many
people. Before the lifeboat was launched he passed along the
port deck of the steamer, commanding the people not to jump<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_53">{53}</a></span>
in the boats, and otherwise restraining them from swamping the
craft. When the collapsible was launched Officer Lowe succeeded
in putting up a mast and a small sail. He collected other boats
together; in some cases the boats were short of adequate crews,
and he directed an exchange by which each was adequately
manned. He threw lines connecting the boats together, two by
two, and all thus moved together. Later on he went back to the
wreck with the crew of one of the boats and succeeded in picking
up some of those who had jumped overboard and were swimming
about. On his way back to the Carpathia he passed one of the
collapsible boats, which was on the point of sinking with thirty
passengers aboard, most of them in scant night-clothing. They
were rescued just in the nick of time.”</p>

<p>Among the first passengers off the Carpathia was Mrs. Paul
Schabert, of Derby, Conn. She said that she had a stateroom on
the port side and had sailed with her brother Phillip. Mrs. Schabert
declared that her brother was saved because she refused to
leave him.</p>

<h3>IN THE GENERAL PANIC CAME THE CRY, “LADIES FIRST.”</h3>

<p>“It was a terrible experience,” Mrs. Schabert added. “I was
awakened by the shock of the collision and went out on deck.
There was very little excitement and persons were coming from
their rooms asking what had happened. Suddenly from the
bridge came the cry ‘ladies first.’ This was the first inkling we
had that the ship was in danger. I went back to my stateroom
and dressed and then as I returned to the deck I heard the horrifying
order that women must leave their husbands and brothers.
I refused to leave my brother, and finally he was shoved into
the boat with me.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Isidor Straus, who had a stateroom near me, and with
whom I have frequently talked, declared that under no circumstances
would she leave Mr. Straus. As we pushed away from
the Titanic the ship started to go down and as she disappeared
beneath the water Mr. and Mrs. Straus were standing arm in
arm.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_54">{54}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Mrs. D. W. Marvin, who was on a honeymoon trip with her
husband, was almost prostrated when she reached the deck and
learned that her husband had not been picked up by some other
boat.</p>

<p>“My God, don’t ask me too much,” she said. “Tell me, have
you any news from Dan? He grabbed me in his arms and knocked
down men to get me into the boat. As I was put in the boat
he cried. ‘It’s all right, little girl; you go and I will stay awhile,
I’ll put on a life preserver and jump off and follow your boat.’ As
our boat shoved off he threw a kiss at me and that is the last I
saw of him.”</p>

<p>Edward Beane, of Glasgow, Scotland, who, with his wife,
occupied a stateroom in the second cabin, declared that fifteen
minutes after the Titanic hit the iceberg there was an explosion
in the engine room, which was followed in a few minutes by a
second explosion.</p>

<h3>FALSE REPORT OF PASSENGERS BEING SHOT.</h3>

<p>“The stern of the boat floated for nearly an hour after the
bow was submerged,” said Mr. Beane, “and then went down. I
heard a report that two steerage passengers were shot by the officers
when they started to crowd in the boats, but later this was denied.”</p>

<p>Max Frolicher-Stehli, who, with his wife and his daughter
Margaret, was on the way to this city to visit a brother, said:</p>

<p>“My wife and two women entered one of the first boats lowered.
Twelve men, including myself, were standing near and as
there were no other women passengers waiting we were ordered
to get in. The sea was calm. We were rowed by four seamen,
one of whom was in charge.</p>

<p>“The order maintained on the Titanic was what I would call
remarkable. There was very little pushing and in most cases it
was the women who caused the commotion by insisting that their
husbands go with them into the lifeboats. As a rule the men
were very orderly. It was not until we had left the ship that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_55">{55}</a></span>
many of the women showed fright. From that time on, however,
they filled the air with shrieks.”</p>

<p>The following statement issued by a committee of the surviving
passengers was given the press on the arrival of the Carpathia.</p>

<p>“We, the undersigned surviving passengers from the S. S.
Titanic, in order to forestall any sensational or exaggerated
statements, deem it our duty to give the press a statement of
facts which have come to our knowledge and which we believe
to be true.</p>

<h3>WARNING TOO LATE TO AVOID COLLISION.</h3>

<p>“On Sunday, April 14, 1912, at about 11.40 P. M., on a cold,
starlight night, in a smooth sea and with no moon, the ship
struck an iceberg which had been reported to the bridge by the
lookouts, but not early enough to avoid collision. Steps were
taken to ascertain the damage and save passengers and ship.
Orders were given to put on life belts and the boats were lowered.
The ship sank at about 2.20 A. M. Monday and the usual
distress signals were sent out by wireless and rockets fired at intervals
from the ship. Fortunately the wireless message was received
by the Cunard’s S. S. Carpathia, at about 12 o’clock, and
she arrived on the scene of the disaster at about 4 A. M. Monday.</p>

<p>“The officers and crew of the S. S. Carpathia had been preparing
all night for the rescue and comfort of the survivors, and
the last mentioned were received on board with the most touching
care and kindness, every attention being given to all, irrespective
of class. The passengers, officers and crew gave up
gladly their staterooms, clothing and comforts for our benefit,
all honor to them.</p>

<p>“On the boat at the time of the collision was: First class,
330; second class, 320; third class, 750; total, 1400; officers and
crew, 940; total, 2340. Of the foregoing about the following
were rescued by S. S. Carpathia:</p>

<p>“First class, 210; second class, 125; third class, 200; officers,
4; seamen, 39; stewards, 96; firemen, 71; total, 210 of the crew.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_56">{56}</a></span>
The net total of 745 saved was about 80 per cent. of the maximum
capacity of the lifeboats.</p>

<p>“We feel it our duty to call the attention of the public to
what we consider the inadequate supply of life-saving appliances
provided for on modern passenger steamships, and recommend
that immediate steps be taken to compel passenger steamers to
carry sufficient boats to accommodate the maximum number of
people carried on board.</p>

<p>“The following facts were observed and should be considered
in this connection: The insufficiency of lifeboats, rafts, etc.;
lack of trained seamen to man same (stokers, stewards, etc., are
not efficient boat handlers); not enough officers to carry out
emergency orders on the bridge and superintend the launching
and control of lifeboats; absence of searchlights.</p>

<p>“The board of trade rules allow for entirely too many people
in each boat to permit the same to be properly handled. On
the Titanic the boat deck was about 75 feet above water, and
consequently the passengers were required to embark before
lowering boats, thus endangering the operation and preventing
the taking on of the maximum number the boats would hold.
Boats at all times to be properly equipped with provisions, water,
lamps, compasses, lights, etc. Life-saving boat drills should be
more frequent and thoroughly carried out; and officers should be
armed at boat drills. Greater reduction in speed in fog and ice,
as damage if collision actually occurs is liable to be less.</p>

<p>“In conclusion, we suggest that an international conference
be called to recommend the passage of identical laws providing
for the safety of all at sea, and we urge the United States Government
to take the initiative as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>The statement was signed by Samuel Goldenberg, chairman,
and a committee of passengers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_57">{57}</a></span></p>

NEGLECT CAUSED DISASTER.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">Tardy Answer to Telephone Call&mdash;Lookout’s Signals Not Answered&mdash;Ship
Could Have Been Saved&mdash;Three Fatal Minutes&mdash;Ismay
Accused&mdash;Women Help With Oars&mdash;Ship
Broken in Two&mdash;Band Played Till Last.</p></div>

<p>The trifle of a telephone call hardly answered sent the Titanic
to the bottom of the Atlantic, occasioned the greatest marine
disaster in history and shocked all civilized nations.</p>

<p>This, at least, is the tale told by sailors of the ill-starred
Titanic, brawny seamen who only lived to tell it because it happened
in the line of their duty to help man the boats into which
some of the Titanic’s passengers were loaded.</p>

<p>But the telephone call that went unanswered for probably
two or three minutes, none can tell the exact time, was sent by
the lookout stationed forward to the first officer of the watch on
the bridge of the great liner on the maiden voyage.</p>

<p>The lookout saw a towering “blue berg” looming up in the
sea path of the Titanic, the latest and proudest product of marine
architecture, and called the bridge on the ship’s telephone.</p>

<p>When after the passing of those two or three fateful minutes
an officer on the bridge of the Titanic lifted the telephone
receiver from its hook to answer the lookout it was too late.
The speeding liner, cleaving a calm sea under a star-studded sky,
had reached the floating mountain of ice, which the theoretically
“unsinkable” ship struck a crashing, if glancing, blow with her
starboard bow.</p>

<p>Had the officer on the bridge, who was William T. Murdock,
according to the account of the tragedy given by two of the Titanic’s
seamen, known how imperative was that call from the
lookout man, whose name was given as Fleet, the man at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_58">{58}</a></span>
wheel of the world’s newest and greatest transatlantic liner might
have swerved the great ship sufficiently to avoid the berg altogether
or at the worst would have probably struck the mass of
ice with her stern and at much reduced speed.</p>

<p>For obvious reasons the identity of the sailormen who described
the foundering of the Titanic cannot be divulged. As
for the officer, who was alleged to have been a laggard in answering
the lookout’s telephone call, harsh criticism may be omitted.</p>

<p>Murdock, if the tale of the Titanic sailor be true, expiated
his negligence, if negligence it was, by shooting himself within
sight of all alleged victims huddled in lifeboats or struggling
in the icy seas.</p>

<h3>THE “UNWRITTEN LAW” OF THE SEA.</h3>

<p>The revolver which the sailors say snuffed out Murdock’s
life was not the only weapon that rang out above the shrieks of
the drowning. Officers of the Titanic, upon whom devolved the
duty of seeing that the “unwritten law” of the sea&mdash;“women and
children first”&mdash;was enforced, were, according to the recital of
the members of the great liner’s crew, forced to shoot frenzied
male passengers, who, impelled by the fear of death, attempted
to get into the lifeboats swinging from their davits.</p>

<p>The sailors’ account of the terrific impact of the Titanic
against the berg that crossed the path was as follows:</p>

<p>“It was 11.40 P. M. Sunday, April 14. Struck an iceberg.
The berg was very dark and about 250 feet in height.</p>

<p>“The Titanic struck the berg a glancing blow on the starboard
bow. The ship, which was traveling between twenty and
twenty-three knots an hour, crashed into the berg at a point
about forty feet back of the stem.</p>

<p>“The Titanic’s bottom was torn away to about fore bridge.
The tear was fully fifty feet in length and was below the water
line.”</p>

<p>Regarding the state of the sea and the character of the night
the sailors declared:</p>

<p>“It was a perfect night, clear and starlight. The sea was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_59">{59}</a></span>
smooth. The temperature had dropped to freezing Sunday
morning. We knew or believed that the cold was due to the
nearness of bergs, but we had not even run against cake ice up
to the time the ice mountain loomed up. The Titanic raced
through a calm sea in which there was no ice into the berg which
sank her.”</p>

<p>Continuing, their joint account the two men of the Titanic’s
crew further said:</p>

<p>“The first officer of the watch was Murdock. He was on the
bridge. Captain Smith may have been near at hand, but he was
not visible to us who were about to wash down the decks. Hitchens,
quartermaster, was at the wheel. Fleet was the outlook.”</p>

<p>It is characteristic of sailors that they make no effort to
learn the baptismal names of a ship’s officers.</p>

<p>“Fleet reported the berg, but the telephone was not answered
on the bridge at once. A few minutes afterwards the telephone
call was answered, but it was too late.</p>

<h3>THE SHIP HAD STRUCK.</h3>

<p>“The ship had struck. Murdock, after the ship struck the
berg, gave orders to put helm to starboard, afterwards he ordered
the helm hard to port and the ship struck the berg again.</p>

<p>“Afterwards Murdock gave an order for the carpenter to
sound the wells to learn how much water the ship was taking in.
The carpenter came up and told Murdock the Titanic had seven
feet of water in her in less than seven minutes.”</p>

<p>Keeping on with their narrative the sailors, whose nerves had
not been broken by their experiences declared:</p>

<p>“Then Captain Smith, who had put in an appearance, gave
orders to get the boats ready.</p>

<p>“There was less than ten minutes between the time the
Titanic first struck the berg and the second crash, both of which
brought big pieces of ice showering down on the ship.</p>

<p>“Orders came to the crew to stand by the boats. The boats
were got out. There were twenty-two boats all told.”</p>

<p>At this juncture the sailors described without apparent prej<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_60">{60}</a></span>udice
or bitterness how J. Bruce Ismay, chairman of the Board of
Directors of the White Star Line, was the first to leave the
Titanic.</p>

<p>“Ismay,” the sailors asserted, “with his two daughters and
a millionaire, Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, and the latter’s family,
got into the first accident or emergency boats, which are about
twenty-eight feet long, and were always ready for lowering under
the bridge. The boat in which Ismay and Sir Cosmo left
was manned by seven seamen. There were seventeen persons
in the boat.</p>

<p>“This boat pulled away from the ship a half hour before any
of the lifeboats were put into the water.</p>

<p>“There were thirteen first-class passengers and five sailors
in the emergency boat. Both boats were away from the ship
within ten or fifteen minutes of the ship’s crashing into the berg.”</p>

<h3>FIRST BOATS TO GET AWAY.</h3>

<p>Asked to explain how it was possible for two boats to be
put over the ship’s side into the water without being subjected
to a rush on the part of the great ship’s passengers, the Titanic
seamen said: “Ismay and those who left in the two emergency
boats occupied cabins de luxe. The two boats were swinging
from davits ready for lowering. We have no idea who notified
Mr. Ismay and his friends to make ready to leave the ship, but
we do know that the boats in which they were got away first.”</p>

<p>The sailors’ seemingly unvarnished tale then went on as
follows:</p>

<p>“It was perhaps a half hour before the first of the lifeboats
was ready for lowering. Not a man was allowed in one of the
lifeboats so far as we could see, only women and children. The
boats were all thirty-six feet long and carried about sixty passengers.
There were about thirty-five or forty passengers to a
boat when they were lowered, but two sailors went in each boat.
Besides the sixteen lifeboats and the two emergency boats, four
collapsible boats, each with a carrying capacity of forty pas<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_61">{61}</a></span>sengers,
were put over the sides of the Titanic, every boat on the
ship was put into the water.</p>

<p>“One of the collapsible boats filled with water. The women
and children in the boat were mostly third-class passengers.
The boat turned keel and nearly two score persons clung to it.
Many of these were rescued by the lifeboats.”</p>

<p>The spokesman for the sailors here asserted: “We want to
make it plain that the officers and crew of the Titanic did their
duty. Not a male passenger got into the lifeboats. During the
early excitement men tried to force their way into the boats, but
the officers shot them down with revolvers. I saw probably a
half dozen men shot down as the lifeboat to which I was assigned
was being filled. The men shot were left to die and sink
on the upper deck of the Titanic.”</p>

<p>The Titanic’s sailors described how frail women, steeled by
a desperate emergency, seized oars and labored with the seamen
to get the lifeboats at a safe distance from the great liner, sinking
deep and deeper under the weight of water.</p>

<h3>WOMEN HELP WITH THE OARS.</h3>

<p>“There were ten oars to each lifeboat,” the sailors said.
“The women seized the sweeps and helped us to get the boats
clear of the ship. We got away about 100 yards from the ship
and waited to see what would happen. The liner was sinking
fast, but the lights continued to shine through the black night.</p>

<p>“The end came at 2.30 on Monday morning. The lights on
the ship did not go out until ten minutes before the liner sank.
The inrushing seas reaching the after fires produced an explosion,
which sundered the big liner. The forward half of the Titanic
dived gently down. The after part of the ship stood on
end and then disappeared.</p>

<p>“The force of the explosion blew, it seemed to us watching
from the lifeboats, scores of passengers and sailors into the air.”</p>

<p>That there were stout hearts on the Titanic, even in the
last moments of an unprecedented catastrophe, that refused to
quail was proven by the rough seamen’s further testimony.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_62">{62}</a></span></p>

<p>“The band on the promenade deck,” they declared, “played
‘Abide With Me’ and ‘Eternal Father, Strong to Save,’ and other
hymns as the ship sank.”</p>

<p>The Titanic sank at 2.30, almost at the spot where she collided
with the mountain of ice.</p>

<p>It was an hour later when the Carpathia was sighted by the
thinly-clad occupants of the lifeboats and it was 4.30 before the
first of the Titanic’s passengers set foot on the deck of the
Cunarder. It was 8 o’clock on Monday morning, April 15, before
the last of the half-clad suffering passengers of the Titanic
were taken aboard the Carpathia, a not difficult feat, as the sea
continued smooth.</p>

<p>The Carpathia’s run from the Newfoundland banks to New
York was uneventful except for the burial at sea of five persons.
Four of the five, according to the sailors, were consigned to the
deep at about 4 P. M. on Monday, April 15. One of the four was
a sailor, one a fireman and two male passengers of the third class.</p>

<h3>TELEPHONE CALL DOUBTED.</h3>

<p>The alleged negligence of Murdock, the first officer of the
watch, who is blamed, as stated above, by some of the sailors for
the wreck in not responding immediately to a telephone call
from the lookout giving warning of the iceberg ahead, is doubted
by a naval man who has had a long experience on transatlantic
liners.</p>

<p>“I cannot help doubting, in fact, absolutely disbelieving,
that an officer of the watch could be negligent in either responding
to a call from the crow’s-nest or even failing to discover anything
in the course of his vessel as soon as the lookout. Especially
considering the fact that the vessel had been warned of
ice several times.</p>

<p>“The position of the senior officer of the watch is on the
windward side of the bridge. He does not depend on the lookout,
that man is only a check upon him. Usually any object in
the course of the vessel is discovered by both at the same time.
The lookout’s signal was not a telephone call when I was on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_63">{63}</a></span>
seas, but a horn blast. Three blasts, object dead ahead; one
blast, object on port bow; two blasts, object on starboard bow.</p>

<p>“That Murdock did not see the berg as soon as his lookout,
seems improbable; that he did not see it immediately after his
lookout, seems impossible; that he did not answer any signal
from the lookout immediately is impossible, unless he was dead.
Murdock knew his responsibility, and he wasn’t shirking. He
wouldn’t have been on the watch, or on the Titanic, if he ever
shirked.</p>

<p>“Could a vessel the size of the Titanic change its course
sufficiently to avoid the berg within three minutes supposed to
have elapsed during which Murdock didn’t answer his lookout’s
call? It could. I never sailed a vessel the size of the Titanic,
but I unhesitatingly say that the Titanic’s course could be
changed in considerably less than a mile. Why, by putting the
wheel hard-a-port and stopping the engines on that side the vessel
could be turned so quickly that it would list fifteen degrees
in swinging around. I have steered a transatlantic liner in and
out among fishing smacks and they are easier to hit than an iceberg.”</p>

<h3>QUESTIONED ABOUT CONDITIONS ON MOONLESS NIGHT.</h3>

<p>Two other seafaring men of long experience, who have
many nights sat in the crow’s-nest of a liner and watched the
course, were asked how far an iceberg the size of the one that the
Titanic struck could be seen on a clear night without a moon, a
condition on which all of the survivors seem to agree was present
the night the Titanic was sunk.</p>

<p>One of these men said at least one mile, the other at least
two miles. So the fact remains that Murdock was supposed to
be on the bridge keeping a strict lookout and not depending on
the crow’s-nest; that he could have seen the iceberg when it was
at least a mile from the vessel, and that the Titanic could have
been easily turned sufficiently in her course to avoid the berg
within a mile.</p>

<p>The surviving passengers are unanimous that the “unbe<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_64">{64}</a></span>lievable”
happened. The voyage had been pleasant and uneventful,
except for the fact that it was being made on the largest and
most magnificent vessel that ever sailed and for the keen interest
which the passengers took in the daily bulletins of the speed.</p>

<p>The Titanic had been making good time and all accounts
agree that on the night of the disaster she was apparently going
at her usual rate&mdash;of from 21 to 25 knots an hour.</p>

<p>J. H. Moody, the quartermaster, who was at the helm, said
that the ship was making twenty-one and that the officers were
under orders at the time to keep up speed in the hope of making
a record passage.</p>

<p>These orders were being carried out in face of knowledge
that the steamer was in the vicinity of great icebergs sweeping
down from the north. That very afternoon, according to the
record of the hyrographic officer, the Titanic had relayed to
shore a wireless warning from the steamer Amerika that an unusual
field of pack ice and bergs menaced navigation off the
Banks.</p>

<h3>OFFICERS CONFIDENT EVEN IN THE FACE OF DANGER.</h3>

<p>But it was a “clear and starlight night,” as all the survivors
described the weather, and the great ship sped through the quiet
seas with officers confident that even though an iceberg should
be seen the vessel could be controlled in ample time, and the passengers
rested in full confidence that their temporary quarters in
the largest and most magnificent vessel ever constructed were
as safe as their own homes.</p>

<p>This confidence is emphasized in the tales of nearly all the
survivors that when the crash came there was almost no excitement.
Many who felt anxious enough to go on deck to inquire
what had happened were little perturbed when they learned that
the ship had “only struck an iceberg.” It appeared to be a glancing
blow and at first there was no indication of a serious accident.</p>

<p>A group of men at cards in the smoking room sent one of
their number to look out of the window, and when he came back<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_65">{65}</a></span>
with the announcement that the boat had grazed an iceberg, the
party went on with the game. It was never finished.</p>

<p>The stoppage of the engines was noticed more than the collision,
the effect being, as one survivor put it, like the stopping of
a loud ticking clock.</p>

<p>The over-confident passengers were not brought to the
slightest realization that the collision might mean serious danger
until the call ran through the ship, “All passengers on deck with
life-belts on.”</p>

<p>Captain Smith, it is said, was not on the bridge when the
collision occurred, but when hurriedly summoned by his first
officer, he took charge of what seemed a hopeless situation in a
manner which the passengers praise as calm, resolute and efficient
to the highest degree.</p>

<p>One of the most stirring narratives of action and description
of scenes that followed the collision was told by L. Beasley, a
Cambridge University man, who was one of the surviving second
cabin passengers.</p>

<h3>THE CREWS ALLOTTED TO THE BOATS.</h3>

<p>“The steamer lay just as if she were awaiting the order to go
on again, when some trifling matter had been adjusted,” he said.
“But in a few minutes we saw the covers lifted from the boats,
and the crews allotted to them standing by ready to lower them
to the water.</p>

<p>“Presently we heard the order, ‘All men stand back and all
ladies retire to the next deck below’&mdash;the smoking room deck or
‘B’ deck. The men stood away and remained in absolute silence,
leaning against the end railing or pacing slowly up and down.</p>

<p>“The boats were swung out and lowered from A deck.
When they were to the level of B deck, where all the ladies were
collected, the ladies got in quietly with the exception of some,
who refused to leave their husbands. In some cases they were
torn from them and pushed into the boats.</p>

<p>“All this time there was no trace of any disorder; no panic
or rush for the boats, and no scenes of women sobbing hysterically.
Everyone seemed to realize so slowly that there was im<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_66">{66}</a></span>minent
danger. When it was realized that we would be presently
in the sea with nothing but our life-belts to support us until we
were picked up by passing steamers, it was extraordinary how
calm everyone was and how complete the self-control.</p>

<p>“One by one the boats were filled with women and children.</p>

<p>“Presently we heard the order, ‘All men stand back,’ and all
lowered and rowed away into the night. Presently the word
went around among the men, ‘The men are to be put in boats on
the starboard side.’ I was on the port side and most of the men
walked across the deck to see if this was so. Presently I heard
the call, ‘Any more ladies?’</p>

<p>“Looking over the side of the ship I saw boat No. 13 swinging
level with B deck, half full of women. I saw no more come,
and one of the crew said then: ‘You’d better jump.’ I dropped
in and fell in the bottom as they cried ‘lower away.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>Beasely said that the lifeboat was nearly two miles away
from the Titanic less than two hours later, when they made out
that the great liner was sinking.</p>

<h3>SHIP APPARENTLY BREAKS IN TWO.</h3>

<p>Other survivors who were nearer to the sinking liner told of
hearing the strains of “Nearer, My God, to Thee” played as the
liner sank, and some of those in the lifeboats blended their voices
in the melody. Suddenly there was a mighty roar and the ship,
already half submerged, was seen to buckle and apparently break
in two by the force of an explosion caused when the water
reached the hot boilers.</p>

<p>The bow sank first and for fully five minutes the stern was
poised almost vertically in the air, when suddenly it plunged out
of sight.</p>

<p>With the last hope gone of seeing their loved ones alive,
many women in the lifeboats seemed to be indifferent whether
they were saved or not. They were nearly 1000 miles from land
and had no knowledge that a ship of succor was speeding to
them. Without provisions or water, there seemed little hope of
surviving long in the bitter cold.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_67">{67}</a></span></p>

<p>There were sixteen boats in the forlorn procession which
entered upon the terrible hours of suspense.</p>

<p>The confidence that the big ship, on which they had started
across the sea, was sure to bring them safely here was now
turned to utter helplessness. But the shock of learning that their
lives were in peril was hardly greater than the relief when, at
dawn, a large steamer’s stacks were seen on the horizon, and
eager eyes soon made out that the vessel was making for the
scene.</p>

<p>The rescue ship proved to be the Carpathia, which had received
the Titanic’s distress signals by wireless.</p>

<p>By 7 o’clock in the morning all the Titanic’s sixteen boats
had been picked up and their chilled and hungry occupants welcomed
over the Carpathia’s side. The Carpathia’s passengers,
who were bound for a Mediterranean cruise, showed every consideration
for the stricken, and many gave up their cabins that
the shipwrecked might be made comfortable.</p>

<p>The rescued were in all conditions of dress and undress, and
the women on the Carpathia vied with one another in supplying
missing garments.</p>

<p>On the four days’ cruise back to New York many, who had
realized that their experiences would be waited by an anxious
world, put their narratives to paper while their nerves were still
at a tension from the excitement of the disaster they had barely
escaped.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_68">{68}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br><br>
BELIEVED SHIP UNSINKABLE.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">Shots and Hymn Mingle&mdash;Titanic Settled Slowly&mdash;Best Traditions
Upheld by Passengers and Crew&mdash;Boiler Explosions Tore
Ship Apart&mdash;Anguish in the Boats&mdash;Survivors Carried to
Carpathia&mdash;Not Enough Provision Against Accident.</p></div>

<p>Outside of great naval battles no tragedy of the sea ever
claimed so many victims as did the loss of the Titanic. The pitiful
part of it is that all on board the Titanic might have been
saved had there been a sufficient number of lifeboats aboard to
accommodate the passengers and crew.</p>

<p>Only sixteen lifeboats were launched, one of these, a collapsible
boat, the last to be launched, was overturned, but was used
as a raft and served to save the lives of many men and women.</p>

<p>Many women went down with the ship&mdash;steerage women,
unable to get to the upper decks where the boats were launched;
maids, who were overlooked in the confusion; cabin passengers,
who refused to desert their husbands, or who reached the decks
after the last of the lifeboats was gone and the ship was settling
for her final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Confidence in the ability of the Titanic to remain afloat led
many of the passengers to death. The theory that the great ship
was unsinkable remained with hundreds who had entrusted
themselves to the gigantic hulk long after the officers knew that
the vessel could not long remain above the surface.</p>

<p>That so many of the men passengers and members of the
crew were saved, while such a large majority of females drowned
was due to the fact that the women had not appeared about the
lifeboats in sufficient numbers to fill them when they first
were launched. Dozens of male survivors assert they were
forced into the first boats lowered against their will by officers<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_69">{69}</a></span>
who insisted that the boats should go overboard filled to their
capacity.</p>

<p>From a rather calm, well ordered sort of leaving of passengers
over the side when the disaster was young the departure of
survivors became a riot as the last boats were lowered and it was
apparent that the Titanic would sink.</p>

<p>Steerage passengers fought their way to the upper decks
and struggled with brutal ferocity against cabin passengers who
were aimlessly trying to save themselves. Officers of the ship
shot down men who sought to jump into already overcrowded
boats. The sound of the pistol shots mingled with the strains
of “Nearer, My God, to Thee,” played by the ship’s orchestra as
the Titanic took her final plunge.</p>

<h3>MURDOCK SHOOTS HIMSELF.</h3>

<p>Murdock, the first officer, who was on the bridge in charge
of the Titanic when she struck the iceberg, shot himself when
convinced the vessel was doomed. The report that Captain
Smith shot himself is contradicted by survivors, who say they
saw him swept from the ship as she went down.</p>

<p>The Titanic settled into the sea gently. The greater part
of her bulk was under water when she slipped beneath the waves.
No trace of suction was felt by those in lifeboats only a few hundred
yards away.</p>

<p>Colonel John Jacob Astor died a hero and went down with
the ship. Had he leaped into the water as she made her final
plunge, he might have been picked up by one of the lifeboats, but
he remained on the deck and was swept under by the drawing
power of the great bulk, bound for the bottom.</p>

<p>All the officers who died and most of the members of the
crew upheld the traditions of heroism held sacred by seamen.
They did their duty to the end and died with their ship. Not a
man in the engine room was saved; not one of them was seen on
deck after the collision. They remained at their posts, far down
in the depths of the stricken vessel, until the waves closed over
what was at once their pride and their burial casket.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_70">{70}</a></span></p>

<p>A boiler explosion tore the Titanic apart shortly before she
sank. This occurred when the sea water, which had been working
its way through the forward compartments, invaded the fireroom.
After the explosion the Titanic hung on the surface, upheld
only by the water-tight compartments, which had not been
touched by the collision.</p>

<p>Although the officers of the Titanic had been warned of the
proximity of ice, she was steaming at the rate of twenty-three
knots an hour when she met her end. The lookouts in the crow’s
nest saw an iceberg ahead and telephoned the bridge. The vessel
swung slightly in response to her rudder, and the submerged
part of the iceberg tore out her plates along the starboard
quarters below the water.</p>

<h3>COMPARTMENT WALL GIVES WAY.</h3>

<p>Water rushed into several of the compartments. The ship
listed to starboard. Captain Smith hurried to the bridge. It
was thought the ship would float, until a shudder, that vibrated
throughout the great frame, told that a compartment wall had
given away. Then a definite order was given to man the lifeboats,
and stewards were sent to instruct passengers to put on
life preservers.</p>

<p>So thoroughly grounded was the belief of the cabin passengers
that the Titanic was unsinkable that few of them took the
accident seriously. Women in evening dress walked out of the
magnificent saloons and joked about the situation. Passengers
protested against getting into the lifeboats, although the ship
was then sinking by the head.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. H. J. Allison and their little daughter remained
on the ship and were lost, after the infant son of the Allison
family had been placed in a lifeboat in charge of a nurse.</p>

<p>Isidor Straus and his wife did not appear on deck until an
order had been issued that only women and children should be
allowed in the lifeboats. Mrs. Straus clung to her husband and
refused to leave him. They died in each other’s arms.</p>

<p>Those who escaped in the first lifeboats were disposed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_71">{71}</a></span>
look on their experience as a lark. The sailors manning the oars
pulled away from the Titanic. The sound of music floated over
the starlit waves. The lights of the Titanic were burning.</p>

<p>Like simultaneous photographs of the same tragedy etched
on the brains of 745 persons, survivors of the Titanic tell of their
experiences and what they saw in those pitifully few hours between
the great ship’s impact on the iceberg and the appalling
moment when she disappeared.</p>

<p>As the survivors came, half fainting, half hysterical, down
the Carpathia’s gang plank, they began to relate these narratives.
Many of these were disjointed, fragmentary&mdash;a picture
here, a frightful flash of recollection there, some bordered on
hallucination, some were more connected as one of those who
are now beginning to realize the horror through which they
came. A few strangely enough, are calm and lucid. But every
one thrills with some part of the awful truth as its narrator saw
it.</p>

<h3>INDIVIDUALLY CONFLICTING STORIES OF THE WRECK.</h3>

<p>Each tale is like another view of the same many-sided shield.
Sometimes they seem to contradict each other, but that is because
those who witness such scenes see them as individuals.
There is not a survivor but has something new and startling and
dramatic to tell.</p>

<p>Taken altogether their accounts are a composite picture of
700 separate experiences.</p>

<p>The shock of the collision had barely jarred the ship. One
man who was directing letters in his cabin kept on with his work
until he felt a sudden shift in the position of the ship and rushed
to the deck in time to leap into a lifeboat. Some of the passengers
had returned to their berths.</p>

<p>Nothing occurred to indicate to the passengers aboard the
Titanic or moving away from the ship in lifeboats that the vessel
would not remain afloat until help should arrive, until the
boilers exploded. Then the end was apparent to all.</p>

<p>Men with life-preservers strapped about their waists, jump<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_72">{72}</a></span>ed
overboard by scores and some were picked up by boats which
had not got far from the ship.</p>

<p>As the last three lifeboats were launched the restriction as
to women and children was removed. It was a free-for-all then
on the deck, where unskilled men, principally stewards, were trying
to get the cumbersome boats overboard. Nearly all
those who took part in that struggle for life are dead. Those
who survived are not anxious to talk about it.</p>

<p>Just before the Titanic disappeared from view men and
women leaped from the stern. As the portion of vessel remaining
above water swung up to an almost perpendicular position
hundreds on the upper decks were thrown into the sea and were
pulled down in the vortex. The biggest, most thrilling moments
of the wreck were those last moments when the air-tight
compartments in the after part of the Titanic were supporting
the balance of the ship.</p>

<h3>KEPT TOGETHER BY GREEN LIGHT.</h3>

<p>None are alive to tell the tale of that short period. Toward
2 o’clock on Monday morning a green light aboard one of the
lifeboats kept the fleet of craft carrying the survivors together.
Through the hours until dawn the men in charge of the boats
hovered about that green light. Occasionally bodies of men
slipped by the lifeboats. A few men, more dead than alive, were
pulled aboard the boats, that were now overcrowded.</p>

<p>The weather became bitterly cold and the survivors suffered
physical pain as well as mental anguish. Benumbed by
the extent of the catastrophe most of the women sat motionless
in their places. The Carpathia appeared soon after dawn.
Not until the big Cunarder was close by did the realization of
what had happened reach the women survivors.</p>

<p>Many of them became temporarily insane. It was necessary
to use force to place them in swings in which they were
hoisted to the Carpathia’s decks. The officers of the Carpathia
knowing the Titanic had gone down, were prepared for an
emergency. Passengers on the Cunarder gave their cabins to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_73">{73}</a></span>
the Titanic sufferers. The captain surrendered his room for
hospital purposes. Stewardesses were compelled to cut the
clothing from some of the women who had jumped into the water
and been picked up by the lifeboats.</p>

<p>Among the survivors picked up by the Carpathia were several
babies. These little ones were tossed overboard by their
parents and rescued by the boats. The identity of these orphans
may never be determined. When the list of persons aboard the
Carpathia was checked up it was found that among the survivors
were thirty women who had been widowed by the disaster.</p>

<p>Nearly all these women, bereft of their life partners, were
reassured by the hope that those who had been left behind had
been picked up by another vessel until they reached New York.
For some reason the impression prevailed on the Carpathia that
the Californian had picked up a number of survivors floating in
the sea upheld by life-preservers.</p>

<h3>EVERY HUSBAND SAVED SAVES HIS WIFE.</h3>

<p>As against the thirty widows stands the record of every
married man who was saved. Each of these men saved his wife
also. No wife was left on the Titanic by a husband who had
reached a lifeboat.</p>

<p>Narratives of the various survivors, assembled in a consecutive
narrative, makes one of the most thrilling tales of modern
life. It is a narrative filled with heroism unparalleled&mdash;bravery
and heroism performed by American business men. They were
men of millions who had everything to live for and yet, in that
crisis at sea, they worked coolly, steadfastly to save women and
children. Then they went down with the White Star liner Titanic,
the greatest ship afloat.</p>

<p>When the Carpathia came into port carrying the more than
700 survivors of the disaster, the curtain, which had hidden the
story of the tragedy since the first word of it was flashed to a
startled world, was drawn aside. Here is the real tale of the
sinking of the Titanic.</p>

<p>The Titanic was athrob with the joy of life on Sunday night,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_74">{74}</a></span>
when without warning, the great liner was jammed against
a partly submerged iceberg. The blow, which was a glancing
one, did not cause much of a jar and there were some on board
who did not know that an accident had happened until later.
The liner struck the berg on the starboard side amidships.</p>

<p>Only Captain E. J. Smith, the commander, realized that
there might be grave danger, and even he did not regard the collision
as fatal. Going to the wireless cabin in which Phillips,
the operator, was in conversation with Cape Race on traffic matters,
he gave orders to the wireless man to hold himself in readiness
to flash out a distress signal.</p>

<p>At the time there was a great throng in the main saloon,
where the ship’s orchestra was giving a concert. Despite the
bitterly cold weather, some of the passengers were taking advantage
of the bright moonlight to stroll upon the decks. Survivors,
who were upon the starboard side, said that the ice mountain
which the vessel struck was at least 150 feet high where exposed.</p>

<h3>UNDER FULL HEAD OF STEAM.</h3>

<p>At the time the ship was steaming ahead under nearly a
full head of steam, at about twenty-one knots. If she had been
going slowly the disaster probably would never have happened.</p>

<p>Acting under orders from Captain Smith, the ship’s officers
passed among the passengers, reassuring them as the rumor
that the ship had struck spread.</p>

<p>“Keep cool; there is no danger,” was the message which,
repeated over and over, gradually became monotonous. The
warning was hardly necessary for none, save the highest officers
of the ship, who were in Captain Smith’s confidence, knew the
real gravity of the situation.</p>

<p>Captain Smith immediately went below and began an examination.
This showed that quick action was necessary. Within
fifteen minutes of his first warning the captain again entered
the wireless cabin and told Phillips to flash the distress signal.</p>

<p>“Send the international call for help, so they will understand.”
Captain Smith said.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_75">{75}</a></span></p>

<p>Bride, the assistant operator, who had been asleep, was
standing at Phillips’ side.</p>

<p>Some of the passengers who had been sleeping were aroused
and left their berths. Many hastened on deck to get a glimpse
of the berg, but, so swiftly was it moving in the gulf stream current,
that, within twenty minutes after the vessel struck it, the
ice mountain had disappeared from view. At 11.50 P. M., fifteen
minutes after the collision, the first intimation of impending
danger was given. Officers passed among the passengers warning
them to put on life belts. The tarpaulins were cast off, the
lifeboats and the life rafts and the davit guys loosened so that the
boats could be swiftly swung over the side.</p>

<p>Members of the crew also donned life preservers; but, with
studied forethought, Captain Smith ordered the principal officers
not to don their belts. They were told, however, to be
ready to do so in an emergency.</p>

<h3>PHILLIPS POUNDS OUT THE S. O. S.</h3>

<p>The ship soon had begun to list. The wireless masts were
sputtering a blue streak of sparks. Phillips at his key pounded
out one “S. O. S.” call after another. He alternated between the
“S. O. S.” and the “C. Q. D.” so that there might be no chance
of the signal being misunderstood.</p>

<p>The first ship to respond to the Titanic was the Frankfurt;
the second was the Carpathia. Phillips told the Carpathia’s
wireless man that the accident was serious and that the White
Star liner was sinking by the head.</p>

<p>“We are putting about and coming to your aid,” was the
reply flashed by the Cunarder.</p>

<p>About 12.15 o’clock the officers began warning the women
to get into the boats. Even at this time no one realized that
there was any danger. Many of the women refused to get into
the boats and had to be placed in them forcibly by the crew.</p>

<p>Colonel and Mrs. John Jacob Astor were walking upon the
deck. They were approached by Captain H. D. Steffason, of
the Swedish Embassy, at Washington. Captain Steffason advis<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_76">{76}</a></span>ed
Mrs. Astor to leave the ship. She demurred, saying there was
no danger. Finally Colonel Astor said:</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear, it is better for you to go; I will follow in another
boat after all the women have been taken off.”</p>

<p>They kissed and parted. It was a beautiful parting.</p>

<p>Mrs. Washington Dodge, of San Francisco, wife of another
prominent passenger, was asleep in her stateroom. She was
aroused by her husband, who urged her to get in a boat. So certain
were both that the measures were only precautionary and
not necessary that they did not even kiss each other good-bye.
Mr. Dodge embarked in another boat.</p>

<p>These incidents are given because they are typical. They
show how little the passengers knew that they were standing
at the brink of death.</p>

<h3>THE GAP INCREASES.</h3>

<p>The riven plates under the water increased the gap, allowing
more and more water to pour into the hold. The steel frame
had been buckled by the impact of the collision and water was
rushing into the supposedly water-tight compartments around
the doors. The dynamo supplying the ship’s searchlight and
the wireless outfit were put out of commission.</p>

<p>Officers hurried hither and thither, reporting to Captain
Smith. This master mariner, hero of the White Star Line, knew
that he was doomed to death by all the traditions of the sea, but
did not flinch. He was the coolest man on board. As lifeboat
after lifeboat was filled and swung over the side it pulled off
some distance and stood by.</p>

<p>When the officers began to load the women of the steerage
into the boats trouble started. Men refused to be separated
from the wives. Families clamored to get into life boats together.
The ship’s officers had a hard time subduing some of the
steerage passengers. The survivors say that some of the men
of the steerage were shot by the ship’s officers.</p>

<p>As the officers were loading the women of the first cabin
list into the boat they came upon Mrs. Isador Straus, the elderly<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_77">{77}</a></span>
wife of the noted philanthropist. She started to get into a boat,
but held back, waiting for her husband to follow. Mr. Straus
tenderly took her in his arms, bade her farewell and explained
that he must abide by the inexorable rule of the sea, which says
women and children must be saved first.</p>

<p>“If you do not go I don’t go,” exclaimed the devoted wife.
She clung to her husband’s arm, and, despite his efforts and the
efforts of officers to persuade her to get into one of the boats,
she refused. The devoted couple went to death together.</p>

<p>While the vessel was going down the call for help was picked
up and acknowledged by the White Star liners Olympic and
Baltic. They turned their heads toward the Titanic, but were
too far away to render aid.</p>

<h3>STRAINS OF MUSIC DROWNS ALL CRIES.</h3>

<p>The band, which had been playing incessantly in the main
saloon, moved out to the open deck and the strains of music
rose above the shouts of the officers and the cries of the passengers.
By 1 o’clock even those who knew nothing of seamanship
began to realize by the angle at which the giant liner careened
that she was in grave danger. By this time more than half of the
life boats had been sent away and they formed a ring in the darkness
about the great vessel.</p>

<p>Excitement began to run high. Major A. W. Butt, U. S.
A., military aide to President Taft; William T. Stead, the famous
journalist; Colonel Aster, and others of the passengers volunteered
their services to Captain Smith. They helped the officers
hold back other male passengers who by this time had become
thoroughly frightened.</p>

<p>As one of the lifeboats was being swung over the ship’s side,
a frantic mother who had been separated from her eight-year-old
boy, cried out hysterically. Colonel Astor was standing by
the boat, assisting the officers. The little boy, in fright and despair,
stretched out his arms appealingly to his mother, but the
officer in command of the boat said that it would not be safe for
another to enter.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_78">{78}</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel Astor, seeing a girl’s hat lying upon the deck,
stealthily placed it upon the boy’s head. Lifting up the child,
he called out: “Surely you will not leave a little girl behind.”
The ruse worked and the child was taken on board.</p>

<p>Up in the wireless room, Bride had placed a life preserver
upon his companion, Phillips, while Phillips sat at his key. Upon
returning from Captain Smith’s cabin with a message, Bride
saw a grimy stoker of gigantic proportions bending over Phillips
removing the life belt. Phillips would not abandon his key
for an instant to fight off the stoker. Bride is a little man (he
was subsequently saved) but plucky. Drawing his revolver he
shot down the intruder and the wireless work went on as though
nothing had happened.</p>

<p>J. Bruce Ismay, managing director of the International Mercantile
Marine Company, owners of the White Star Line, was
sitting in the cafe chatting to some friends when the liner ran
upon the berg. He was the first one informed by Captain Smith.
Ismay rushed to the deck to look at the berg.</p>

<h3>“THE SHIP CANNOT SINK.”</h3>

<p>“The ship cannot sink,” was the reply which he gave, with
smiling assurance, to all inquirers.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are survivors who say that Ismay was
one of the passengers of the lifeboats which put off. They saw
him enter the boat.</p>

<p>By 1.30 o’clock the great vessel, which only a short time before
had been the marvel of the twentieth century, was a water-logged
hulk. Panic was steadily growing. The word had been
passed around that the ship was doomed. The night continued
calm. The sea was smooth. The moon was brilliant in the sky.</p>

<p>Into one of the last of the lifeboats that were launched two
Chinamen, employed in the galley, had hidden themselves. They
were stretched in the bottom of the boat, face downward, and
made no sound. So excited were the women that they did not
notice the presence of the Chinese until the boat had pulled off<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_79">{79}</a></span>
from the Titanic. Then the officer in charge drew his revolver
and shot both to death. The bodies were tumbled overboard.</p>

<p>The weather was very cold and the sea was filled with floating
ice. All were warned before getting into the boats to dress
as warmly as possible. By the time the boats were filled the
water had entered the engine-room and the ship was drifting
helplessly. About 2 o’clock Captain Smith, who had been standing
upon the bridge with a megaphone to his mouth, again went
to the wireless cabin.</p>

<p>“Men,” he said to Phillips and Bride, with a break in his
voice, “you have done your full duty. You can do no more.
Abandon your cabin, for it is now every man for himself.”</p>

<p>Bride left the cabin, but Phillips still clung to his key. He
perished. The saving of Bride, the second wireless man, was
only one of a series of thrilling escapes. Wearing a life belt,
Bride went upon deck. He saw a dozen men passengers tugging
at a collapsible boat trying to work it to the edge of the deck.</p>

<h3>BRIDE SWEPT OVERBOARD.</h3>

<p>The wireless man went to their assistance and they had got
it nearly to the point from which they could swing it over,
when a wave rolled over the deck. Bride, who had hold of an
oar lock, was swept overboard with the boat. The next thing he
knew he was struggling in the water beneath the boat.</p>

<p>The icy water struck a chill through him. He realized that
unless he got from beneath the boat he would drown. Diving
deeply, he came up on the outside of the gunwale and grasped
it. On every hand was wreckage of all kinds and struggling
men who had been washed overboard by the submerging comber.
Bride clung to the craft until he saw another boat near by. Exerting
all his strength, he swam to this boat and was pulled in it
more dead than alive.</p>

<p>By this time all the boats and life rafts had been taken from
the ship. The boats were ringed about the ship from 150 feet
to 1,000 yards distant. Their occupants could see the lights
burning on the vessel which had settled low in the water.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_80">{80}</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly as they looked great billows of live sparks rose up
through the four funnels. These were followed by billowing
clouds of smoke and steam. The rush of water had reached the
boiler rooms and the boilers had exploded. After this the great
vessel sank more rapidly and within less than twenty minutes
had plunged to her grave, two miles beneath the surface.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, those upon the sinking ship, who
knew that they had only a few hours at most to live, lived up to
the most splendid example of Anglo-Saxon courage. As the ship
sank lower those on board climbed higher, prolonging life to the
last minute. Frenzied search was made of every part of the
decks by those who hoped that the sailors had overlooked a life
raft or small boat which might be used. Their search was vain.</p>

<p>Colonel Astor, Major Butt, C. M. Hays, W. M. Clark and
other friends stood together. Astor and Butt were strong swimmers.
When the water reached the ship’s rail, Butt and Astor
jumped and began swimming rapidly away. There was little
suction despite the bulk of the foundering craft.</p>

<h3>SHIP DISAPPEARS FROM VIEW.</h3>

<p>There was a dreadful cry as the ship disappeared from view.
Instantly the water was filled with hundreds of struggling men.
The spot just above the grave of the liner was strewn with
wreckage. Some tried to climb upon the ice cakes. But the
cold air and the cold water soon numbed the fingers of the men
in the water. Even the most powerful of the refugees soon gave
out. Exhausted by their effort and numb from exposure they
dropped one by one.</p>

<p>There are survivors, however, among them Dr. Henry J.
Frauenthal, of this city, who said that they heard cries from the
water for two hours after the Titanic sank. Amidst the acres
and acres of wreckage hundreds of dead bodies floated. Many
of them were among the first cabin passengers, still dressed in
their evening clothes which they had worn when the ship struck
the iceberg.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_81">{81}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br><br>
HOW SURVIVORS ESCAPED.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">Managing Director Accused&mdash;Stoker Makes Direct Charge&mdash;Supported
by Many Survivors&mdash;Tells about It&mdash;“Please
Don’t Knock”&mdash;Demanded Food&mdash;Brave Lot of Women&mdash;First
Officer Shot Himself.</p></div>

<p>One man stands out in a most unenviable light amid the
narratives of heroism and suffering attending the great Titanic
sea tragedy. This man is J. Bruce Ismay, managing director of
the White Star Line, who, according to accounts of survivors,
made himself the exception to the rule of the sea, “Women first,”
in the struggle for life.</p>

<p>Some of these survivors say he jumped into the first life
boat, others that he got into the third or fourth. However that
may be, he is among the comparatively few men saved, and the
manner of his escape aroused the wrath and criticism of many.</p>

<p>A woman with a baby was pushed to the side of the third
boat, says one survivor. Ismay got out; he then climbed into the
fourth boat. “I will man this boat,” he said, and there was no
one who said him nay.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ismay was in the first lifeboat that left the Titanic,”
declared William Jones, an eighteen-year-old stoker, who was
called to man one of the lifeboats. Jones comes from Southampton,
England, and this was his first ocean voyage. He left the
Carpathia tottering. “There were three firemen in each boat,”
he said. “I don’t know how many were killed in the boiler explosion
which occurred after the last lifeboat had put off. I saw
four boats, filled with first cabin passengers, sink. In the boat I
was in, two women died from exposure. We were picked up
about 8 o’clock.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_82">{82}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lucien P. Smith, of Huntingdon, W. Va., daughter of
Representative James Hughes, West Virginia, was in the third
boat that was launched, and in that boat was Mrs. John Jacob
Astor. “My niece saw Mr. Ismay leaving the boat. He was attended
by several of the crew and every assistance was given him
to get into the boat,” says Mrs. Smith. “And when the Carpathia
finally came along and rescued the shipwrecked passengers,
some of the crew of the Carpathia, together with men of the
Titanic, actually carried Mr. Ismay to spacious rooms that had
been set aside for him. As soon as Mr. Ismay had been placed in
this stateroom a sign was placed on the door: “Please don’t
knock.”</p>

<h3>MRS. W. J. CARDEZA’S NARRATIVE.</h3>

<p>According to Mrs. W. J. Cardeza, of Philadelphia, who gave
her narrative after she had arrived at the Ritz-Carlton with T.
D. M. Cardeza, J. Bruce Ismay was not only safely seated in a
lifeboat before it was filled, but he also selected the crew that
rowed the boat. According to Mrs. Cardeza, Mr. Ismay knew
that Mr. Cardeza was an expert oarsman and he beckoned him
into the boat. Mr. Cardeza manned an oar until Mr. Ismay’s
boat was picked up about two hours later.</p>

<p>The White Star Line, through Ismay, disclaimed responsibility,
saying that it was “an act of God.” Ismay defended his
action in taking to the lifeboat. He said that he took the last
boat that left the ship. “Were there any women and children
left on the Titanic when you entered the boat?” he was asked.
The reply was, “I am sure I cannot say.”</p>

<p>J. Bruce Ismay described to a reporter how the catastrophe
occurred. “I was asleep in my cabin,” said Mr. Ismay, “when
the crash came. It woke me instantly. I experienced a sensation
as if the big liner were sliding up on something.</p>

<p>“We struck a glancing blow, not head on, as some persons
have supposed. The iceberg, so great was the force of the blow,
tore the ship’s plates half way back, I think, although I cannot
say definitely. There was absolutely no disorder.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_83">{83}</a></span></p>

<p>“I left in the last boat. I did not see the Titanic sink. I cannot
remember how far away the lifeboat in which I was had been
rowed from the ship when she sank.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ismay began his interview by reading a prepared statement,
to this effect:</p>

<p>“In the presence and under the shadow of so overwhelming
a tragedy I am overcome with feelings too deep for words. The
White Star Line will do everything humanly possible to alleviate
the sufferings of the survivors and the relatives of those who
were lost.</p>

<p>“The Titanic was the last word in ship building. Every
British regulation had been complied with and her masters, officers
and crew were the most experienced and skillful in the
British service.</p>

<h3>WELCOMES EXHAUSTIVE INQUIRY.</h3>

<p>“I am informed that a committee of the United States Senate
has been appointed to investigate the accident. I heartily
welcome a most complete and exhaustive inquiry as the company
has absolutely nothing to conceal and any aid that my associates
or myself, our ship builders or navigators can render will
be at the service of both the United States and the British Governments.”</p>

<p>“How soon did she sink after she struck?” Mr. Ismay was
asked. “Let me see, it was two hours and twenty-five minutes, I
think. Yes, that is right.”</p>

<p>“In other words, there would have been ample time to have
taken everybody off if there had been enough lifeboats?” he was
asked. “I do not want to talk about that now,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Did you go off in the first boat?” some one asked. “What
do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Were you in the first boat that left the ship?” “No,” he
replied, slowly and firmly, “I was not. I was in the last boat.
It was one of the forward boats.”</p>

<p>“Did the captain tell you to get in the boat?” “No.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_84">{84}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“What was the captain doing when you last saw him?”
“He was standing on the bridge.”</p>

<p>“It is not true that he committed suicide?” “No. I heard
nothing of it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ismay was asked to explain the delay in the sending of
the news of the wreck from the Carpathia. He said:</p>

<p>“I can’t say anything about that now except that I sent the
first telegram announcing what had happened to Mr. Franklin
about 11 o’clock on the morning that we were picked up. I am
told that that telegram did not reach its destination here until
yesterday.”</p>

<p>In response to requests for more details Mr. Ismay said:
“I must refuse to say more until to-morrow, when I appear before
the Congressional Committee.”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, get me something to eat. I’m starved. I
don’t care what it costs or what it is. Bring it to me.”</p>

<h3>AN OFFICER’S COMPLETE ACCOUNT.</h3>

<p>This was the first statement made by Ismay, a few minutes
after he was landed on board the Carpathia. It is vouched for
by an officer of the Carpathia. This officer gave one of the most
complete accounts of what happened aboard the Carpathia from
the time she received the Titanic’s appeal for assistance until
she landed the survivors at the Cunard line pier.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ismay reached the Carpathia in about the tenth lifeboat,”
said the officer. “I didn’t know who he was, but afterward
I heard the others of the crew discussing his desire to get something
to eat the minute he put his foot on deck. The steward
who waited on him, McGuire, from London, says Mr. Ismay
came dashing into the dining room, and, throwing himself in a
chair, said, ‘Hurry, for God’s sake, and get me something to eat;
I’m starved. I don’t care what it costs or what it is; bring it to
me.’</p>

<p>“McGuire brought Mr. Ismay a load of stuff, and when he
had finished it he handed McGuire a two-dollar bill. ‘Your
money is no good on this ship.’ McGuire told him. ‘Take it,’ in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_85">{85}</a></span>sisted
Mr. Ismay, shoving the bill in McGuire’s hand. ‘I am well
able to afford it. I will see to it that the boys of the Carpathia
are well rewarded for this night’s work.’ This promise started
McGuire making inquires as to the identity of the man he had
waited on. Then we learned that he was Mr. Ismay. I did not
see Mr. Ismay after the first few hours. He must have kept to
his cabin.</p>

<p>“The Carpathia received her first appeal from the Titanic
about midnight, According to an officer of the Titanic, that
vessel struck the iceberg at twenty minutes to 12 o’clock and
went down for keeps at nineteen minutes after 2 o’clock. I turned
in on Sunday night a few minutes after 12 o’clock. I hadn’t
closed my eyes before a friend of the chief steward told me that
Captain Rostron had ordered the chief steward to get out 3,000
blankets and to make preparations to care for that many extra
persons. I jumped into my clothes and was informed of the Titanic.
By that time the Carpathia was going at full speed in the
direction of the Titanic.</p>

<h3>THE CREW TOLD WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THEM.</h3>

<p>“The entire crew of the Carpathia was assembled on deck
and were told of what had happened. The chief steward, Harry
Hughes, told them what was expected of them.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Every man to his post and let him do his full duty like a
true Englishman,’ he said. ‘If the situation calls for it, let us
add another glorious page to British history.’</p>

<p>“After that every man saluted and went to his post. There
was no confusion. Everything was in readiness for the reception
of the survivors before 2 o’clock. Only one or two of the
passengers were on deck, one of them, Mr. Beachler, having been
awakened by a friend, and the other because of inability to sleep.
Many of the Carpathia’s passengers slept all through the morning
up to 10 o’clock, and had no idea of what was going on.</p>

<p>“We reached the scene of the collision about 4 o’clock. All
was black and still but the mountain of ice just ahead told the
story. A flare from one of the lifeboats some distance away was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_86">{86}</a></span>
the first sign of life. We answered with a rocket, and then there
was nothing to do but wait for daylight.</p>

<p>“The first lifeboat reached the Carpathia about half-past 5
o’clock in the morning, and the last of the sixteen boats was unloaded
before 9 o’clock. Some of the lifeboats were only half
filled, the first one having but two men and eleven women, when
it had accommodations for at least forty. There were few men
in the boats. The women were the gamest lot I have ever seen.
Some of the men and women were in evening clothes, and others
among those saved had nothing on but night clothes and raincoats.</p>

<h3>IMAGINE THEIR HUSBANDS PICKED BY OTHER VESSELS.</h3>

<p>“As soon as they were landed on the Carpathia many of the
women became hysterical, but on the whole they behaved splendid.
Men and women appeared to be stunned all day Monday,
the full force of the disaster not reaching them until Tuesday
night. After being wrapped up in blankets and given brandy
and hot coffee, their first thoughts were for their husbands and
those at home. Most of them imagined that their husbands had
been picked up by other vessels and then began flooding the wireless
rooms with messages. We knew that those who were not on
board the Carpathia had gone down to death, and this belief was
confirmed Monday afternoon when we received a wire from Mr.
Marconi himself asking why no news had been sent.</p>

<p>“We knew that if any other vessel could by any chance have
picked them up it would have communicated with land. After a
while, when the survivors failed to get any answer to their
queries, they grew so restless that Captain Rostron posted a notice
that all private messages had been sent and that the wireless
had not been used to give information to the press, as had
been charged. Little by little it began to dawn on the women
on board, and most of them guessed the worst before they reached
here. I saw Mrs. John Jacob Astor when she was taken from
the lifeboat. She was calm and collected. She kept to her state<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_87">{87}</a></span>room
all the time, leaving it only to attend a meeting of the survivors
on Tuesday afternoon.”</p>

<p>J. R. Moody was a quartermaster on the bridge beside First
Officer Murdock when the Titanic struck the berg. “There is
no way of telling the approach of the berg, and, besides, I do not
intend to go into that now,” said Moody. “We struck, and we
paid dearly for it, and that is all there is to that now. We were
running between twenty-two and twenty-three knots an hour.
It seemed incredible that much damage had been done at first, we
struck so lightly. There was a little jar. Almost immediately,
though, Captain Smith rushed to the bridge and took charge.
Afterward I saw Murdock, standing on the first deck. I saw him
raise his arm and shoot himself. He dropped where he stood.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>WIRELESS TELEGRAPHIC APPARATUS.</div>

<p>“As far as Mr. Bruce Ismay goes, he was in the second boat
that left the Titanic. The first boat swamped. I am sure of that,
and Mr. Ismay was bundled into the second boat, regardless of
his protests, to take charge of it in place of First Officer Murdock,
who had shot himself.</p>

<p>“When the Titanic started to sink Captain Smith was on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_88">{88}</a></span>
bridge. I saw him. The first lurch brought the bridge almost
under water, and the captain was washed off. He clambered
back, and must have been there another ten minutes. When the
bridge sank slowly down and he was washed off for the second
time, a boat tried to make back to him, but he waved for it to
keep back. The last anybody saw of him he was fighting his way
back to the Titanic. He drowned fighting to reach her.”</p>

<p>“J. Bruce Ismay never showed himself once during the whole
voyage and on the voyage on the Carpathia. We never saw him
from the time the vessel took up the survivors until we reached
the dock. Personally I do not think that Captain Smith was responsible
for the high rate of speed at which the Titanic was
traveling when the ship foundered. I kept a record during the
voyage. From noon of Saturday to noon of Sunday the Titanic
traveled 546 knots. I believe they were trying to break records.
When the crash came the boat was traveling at top speed.”</p>

<h3>HENRY E. STENGEL’S STORY.</h3>

<p>This was the statement which Henry E. Stengel gave early
today at his residence, 1075 Broad st., Newark, N. J. Shaken
with the horrors of the wreck and the nerve-racking voyage on
the rescue ship Carpathia, Mr. Stengel spoke in stern terms of
the recklessness which made the accident so appalling. Although
it was near to midnight when he and his wife reached Newark,
there were a hundred friends waiting to receive them, all of
whom hung breathlessly on the recital of the perils which the
two escaped.</p>

<p>Mr. Stengel and his wife had one of the most remarkable
reunions of any persons on the ship. The two did not escape in
the same boat. Mrs. Stengel being in the first launched, while
her husband was in the very last boat from the starboard side.
Mrs. Stengel looked many years older than when she left the
other side a few weeks ago, and was even more emphatic than her
husband in criticism of the shortcomings of the White Star officials.</p>

<p>“There was absolutely no water in our boat. We would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_89">{89}</a></span>
died of thirst if rescue had not been near at hand,” she said. “I
understand it was the way in all the other lifeboats, few of which
even had lanterns. I have heard that a couple of them were provided
with bread at the last moment, but our boat was absolutely
without any food.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Stengel was worn by the constant strain which had
been pressing upon her in the last five days. “This has been such
a terrible worry that I feel as though I could never sleep again,”
she said. “Oh, it was horrible, horrible. Sometimes I think that
I would have been better dead than to have so much to remember.
You see when the crash first came no one realized the awful seriousness
of the situation. It was a loud, grinding crash and it
shook the boat like a leaf, but we had all become so filled with the
idea that the Titanic was a creation greater than the seas that no
one was terror-stricken. Some of the women screamed and children
cried, but they told us it was all right and that nothing serious
could happen.</p>

<h3>DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE HER HUSBAND.</h3>

<p>“I was just preparing for sleep when the crash came, and
throwing on some clothes, I rushed on deck with my husband. In
a short time we were told that the women would be sent in the
boats. I did not want to leave my husband, but he laughed and
told me that the boating was only temporary. There was very
little confusion when we put off and the men in the first and
second cabins were absolutely calm. Mr. Stengel kissed me and
told me not to worry, that he would come in a later boat, unless
it was decided to bring us back on the ship.</p>

<p>“For some reason no attention was paid to the men who
were put in our boat. One of them was an undersized Chinaman
and the other was an Oriental of some kind. When the lifeboat
struck the water they crawled up in the bottom and began to
moan and cry. They refused to take their places at the oars
and first class women passengers had to man many of the rowlocks.
Still none of us thought that the great Titanic would
sink. We rowed two hundred yards away, as they had told us,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_90">{90}</a></span>
watching the great ship. Then the lights began to go out and
then came a terrible crash like dynamite.</p>

<p>“I heard a woman in the bow scream and then came three
more terrific explosions. The boat gave a sudden lurch and then
we saw the men jumping from the decks. Some of us prayed and
I heard women curse, but the most terrible thing was the conduct
of the Chinaman and the Oriental. They threw themselves
about the boat in absolute fits and almost upset the boat. They
were a menace during the whole night and in the morning when
the light began to come in the east and when the women were
exhausted from trying to man the oars, the two of them found
some cigarettes and lay in the bottom of the boat and smoked
while we tried to work the oars.”</p>

<p>There is no survivor better qualified to tell of the last incidents
aboard the vessel than Mr. Stengel is. He was one of the
last three men to leave the boat. He is a man of scientific turn
of mind and is in possession of some valuable data concerning
the wreck.</p>

<h3>LITTLE DISORDER ON BOARD.</h3>

<p>“As my wife has told you, there was but little disorder on
board after the crash,” he said. “I realized the seriousness of
the situation immediately, because I saw Captain Smith come
out of the cabin. He was closely followed by Mr. and Mrs.
George Widener, of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>What is the outlook?’ I heard Mr. Widener inquire. ‘It
is extremely serious, gentlemen,’ he said. ‘Please keep cool and
do what you can to help us.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>Deck stewards rushed through the corridors rapping frantically
on the doors of the occupied cabins. All were told that
the danger was imminent. Some heeded and grasping the first
clothing they could find, they rushed on deck. Others refused
to come out. They would not believe there was danger.</p>

<p>On deck the boat crews were all at their posts. The big lifeboats
had been shoved around ready to be put over the side.
Women and children were picked up bodily and thrown into<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_91">{91}</a></span>
them. The rule of the sea, women and children first, was being
enforced.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/i_091.jpg">
<img src="images/i_091.jpg" width="312" height="366" alt="[The image is unavailable.]"></a>

</div>

<p>One after the other the boats went over the side. Then a
cry was set up: “There are no more boats!” was the shout. Consternation
seized upon all that remained. They had believed
there would be room for all. Uncontrollable terror seized many.
They fought for the life belts. Some frantically tried to tear
loose deck fittings hoping to make small rafts that would sustain
them until help would come. But everything was bolted
fast. Then, fearful that they would be dragged to death in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_92">{92}</a></span>
swirling suction that would follow, the men began to leap into
the ice filled ocean.</p>

<p>They jumped in groups, seemingly to an agreed signal, according
to the stories of the survivors tonight. Some who jumped
were saved, coming up near lifeboats and being dragged into
them by the occupants.</p>

<p>Slowly, steadily and majestically, the liner sank. One deck
after the other was submerged. Whether the boilers exploded is
a question. Robert W. Daniel, a Philadelphia banker, says that
when the icy water poured into the boiler room two separate explosions
followed that tore the interior out of the liner. Others
say they did not hear any explosions.</p>

<h3>PISTOL SHOTS FIRED.</h3>

<p>Pistol shots were fired. Some survivors say they were fired
at men who tried to force women and children out of the way.
No one who claimed to be an eye-witness to the shooting could
be located. One account related in circumstantial detail that
the captain and his first officer shot themselves, but Daniel and
other passengers positively say they saw the white bearded,
grizzled face of the veteran mariner over the top of the bridge
just before the railing disappeared. They say that not until then
did he jump into the ocean to drown in the suction that marked
the last plunge of the Titanic.</p>

<p>The plight of the survivors in the boats was pitiful in the extreme.
Few of the women or children had sufficient clothing,
and they shivered in the bitter cold blasts that came from the
great field of ice which surrounded them. The bergs and cakes
of drift ice crashed and thundered bringing stark terror to the
helpless victims.</p>

<p>Frail women aided with the heavy oars tearing their tender
hands until the blood came. Few of the boats were fully manned,
sailors had stood aside deliberately, refusing life that the
women might have a chance for safety although their places
were in the boats.</p>

<p>Daybreak found the little flotilla bobbing and tossing on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_93">{93}</a></span>
surface of the ocean. It was not known whether help was coming.
Panic seized some of the occupants, some of the women
tried to jump into the water, and had to be forcibly restrained.
The babies, little tots, just old enough to realize their position,
found themselves heroes. They set an example which moved
their elders to tears as they told of it to-night. Some tried to
comfort their stricken parents.</p>

<p>Finally, off in the distant horizon, a sailor in the leading
boat, discerned smoke. “We are saved,” went up the cry, and
the rescue came just in time, for before the Carpathia had taken
aboard the occupants of the last frail craft the waves were increasing
in height, kicked up by the wind that had increased
with the rising of the sun.</p>

<p>All were tenderly cared for on the Cunard liner. The regular
passengers willingly gave up their cabins to their unfortunate
refugees, medical aid was forthcoming, and nothing left undone
that could relieve the distress.</p>

<h3>DID NOT SEE ANY SHOTS FIRED.</h3>

<p>“It was his face, more than anything else, which made me
fearful,” continued Mr. Stengel. “He looked like an old, old
man. I heard him give instructions to his officers, and they took
their stations at the boats. I did not see anyone shot during
the whole wreck. They fired three shots in the air to show the
steerage men that the guns were loaded, but I was on the boat
almost to the last, and I didn’t see anyone shot. The boat which
saved me was not a regular lifeboat, but a light emergency boat.
There was a great rush for it. By the time it was launched the
first fear had subsided. It was the last to be lowered from the
starboard side.</p>

<p>“The Titanic seemed to be floating safely, and a lot of people
preferred it to the flimsy looking rowboats. A deckhand told
me that there was a vacant place in it. There I found Sir Cosmo
Duff-Gordon, Lady Duff-Gordon and their maid, Miss Francatelli.
Just as the boat was being lowered Mr. A. L. Solomon
jumped in. We had gone but a little way from the ship when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_94">{94}</a></span>
first boiler explosion came. It was followed in quick succession
by three others, at intervals of about one second apart.”</p>

<p>In the boat which harbored Mr. Stengel were three stokers
and two members of the steerage. Mr. Stengel told graphically
of the last plunges of the ship and its final sinking. He declared
that there was a little eddy and no whirlpool when it sank. Many
of the men on the Titanic jumped into sea before the decks were
awash. In telling of the long night on the sea Mr. Stengel gave
great credit to a member of the crew who had taken three green
lanterns on board just as the small lifeboat was manned.</p>

<p>He said that it was the only beacon which the other lifeboats
had for guidance, and said that without it many more
would surely have been lost.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stengel spoke particularly of the calmness of the night.</p>

<p>“When the sun rose there was not a ripple on the water,”
she said. “It was as calm as a little lake in Connecticut. Words
cannot express the wonderful terrible beauty of it all&mdash;but of
course I couldn’t appreciate it, because I thought my husband
had gone down in the sea.</p>

<p>“The shout of ‘land’ ever uttered by an explorer was not
half so joyful as the shout of ‘ship!’ which went up when the Carpathia
appeared on the horizon that morning,” she said. “The
first dim lights which appeared were eagerly watched and when
it was really identified as a ship, men and women broke down
and wept.”</p>

<p>The reunion of Mr. and Mrs. Stengel was on the Carpathia.
Each was mourning the other as lost for more than an hour after
they had been on the vessel, when they met on the promenade
deck. Their separation and subsequent reunion was generally
considered one of the most remarkable in the history of the
wreck.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_95">{95}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br><br>
WOMAN’S THRILLING NARRATIVE.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">Barber Says Good Word for Accused Shipowner&mdash;Claims He
was a Witness&mdash;Saw the Whole Scene&mdash;Woman Tells Different
Tale&mdash;Mrs. Carter’s Thrilling Narrative&mdash;Barber’s
Story Differs From Ismay’s Own.</p></div>

<p>J. Bruce Ismay, managing director of the White Star Line,
who has been widely charged with cowardice in saving himself
when the Titanic was wrecked, has found his first defender in the
person of August H. Weikman, “commodore” barber of that
company’s fleet, who was chief ship’s barber on the ill-fated
vessel.</p>

<p>Weikman declares that he was a witness of the scene when
Ismay left the vessel, and that he literally was thrown into the
lifeboat by a seaman, who did not recognize him, and thought
he was interfering with the work. He asserts that Ismay was
striving valiantly to help in the work of launching the boats, and
went overboard only under physical compulsion.</p>

<p>Weikman was accompanied to his home in Palmyra, N. J.,
by his brothers-in-law, A. H. and John Henricks, who tell of a
vexatious experience in getting him off the Carpathia. Weikman
was badly injured when he was blown off the ship by the
explosion of the boilers.</p>

<p>A. H. Henricks charges that the custom officials refused
him a pass to the pier because he wanted to get a member of
the ship’s crew, and the official said they were not bothering
about the crew. The brothers finally made their way to the
pier by running between double lines of automobiles. Weikman
was brought off the Carpathia on a rolling chair too late
to catch the special train which came to this city, and the Penn<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_96">{96}</a></span>sylvania
Railroad officials provided him with a berth free of
charge.</p>

<p>“I was in my barber shop reading,” said Weikman, “when
I felt a slight jar and realized we had struck something. I went
to the gymnasium to see whether others had noticed it. I found
some of the men punching the bag, while Colonel Astor, Mr.
Widener and a number of others were watching them.</p>

<p>“I had known Mr. Widener for some time, and I advised
him to put on a life belt. He laughed at me.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>What sense is there in that? This boat isn’t going to
sink,’ he said to me. ‘There is plenty of time. We’re safer here
than in a small boat, anyway.’</p>

<p>“Then came the order to man the boats and I went on deck
to help. I saw Mr. Ismay at the rail, directing and helping the
men. One of them did not recognize him and said: ‘What are
you interfering for? You get back out of the way.’</p>

<h3>“GET BACK OR GO OVERBOARD.”</h3>

<p>“Another seaman warned the first man that he was speaking
to the head of the line. ‘I don’t care who he is; he’s got to
get back or go overboard. We can’t be bothered with him and
his orders now,’ was the reply. Mr. Ismay stuck to his place
and continued giving orders and directing the men.</p>

<p>“The rule was observed of sending over four women and
then a man to look after them. When four women had been put
over, the seaman turned to Mr. Ismay and ordered him over the
side. Mr. Ismay refused to go, when the seaman seized him,
rushed him to the rail and hurled him over. I saw that myself,
and I know that Mr. Ismay did not go of his own accord and that
the charge of cowardice is unfair and untrue.</p>

<p>“While I was still helping at the boats there came an explosion
from below-decks and the ship took an awful lunge,
throwing everybody into a heap. I was hurled clear of the vessel’s
side and landed on top of a bundle of deck-chairs which was
floating on the water. I was badly bruised and my back was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_97">{97}</a></span>
sprained. My watch stopped at 1.50 A. M. and I believe it was
at that time I was thrown into the water.</p>

<p>“While I lay floating on the bundle of chairs there came
another terrific explosion and the ship seemed to split in two.
There was a rain of wreckage and a big piece of timber fell on
me, striking my lifebelt. I believe if it had not been for the belt
I would have been killed. I floated for what I believe was about
two hours. Then arms reached down and drew me aboard a life
raft. The man who did this was a seaman named Brown, whose
life I probably had saved two years ago by hurrying him to a
hospital in England when he was taken ill suddenly.</p>

<p>“There were six persons on the raft and others were in the
water up to their necks, hanging on to the edges of the raft. The
raft was already awash, and we could not take them aboard.
One by one, as they became chilled through, they bade us good-bye
and sank. In the bottom of the raft was a man whom I had
shaved that morning, and whom I had been told was worth
$5,000,000. I did not know his name. He was dead.</p>

<h3>PICKED UP BY THE CARPATHIA.</h3>

<p>“And so we floated on the raft, bereft of hope and stupefied
by the calamity, until picked up by the Carpathia. I was so badly
injured they had to take me on board in a boatswain’s chair.”</p>

<p>The happiness of husbands at seeing their wives put in the
way of safety from the Titanic was described by Mrs. Turrell
Cavendish, daughter of Henry Siegel. She said: “I was with
my husband in our stateroom when the accident happened. He
awakened me, I remember it was midnight and told me something
was the matter with the boat.</p>

<p>“My husband kissed me and put me into a boat, in which
were twenty-three women. He told me to go and that he would
stay on the ship with the other men. They were happy to see
their wives lowered away in the boats. They kept telling us they
would be all right because the ship could not sink.</p>

<p>“We were lowered into the water without any light, only
one man tried to get into the boat. He was pushed back by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_98">{98}</a></span>
sailor. Most of the women in the boat I was in were in their bare
feet. I can still see those husbands kissing their wives and telling
them good-bye. I can see the sailors standing by so calm
and brave. The sight of those good men who gave their lives
for others will always be with me. Words can’t tell the tale of
their sacrifice.</p>

<p>“The hours we spent in that small boat after those heroic
men went down were hours of torture. When we got on the
Carpathia we were treated with the utmost consideration.</p>

<p>“I saw Mr. Ismay when he came on board. He was trembling
from head to foot and kept saying, ‘I’m Ismay, I’m Ismay’.”</p>

<p>Immediately upon their disembarkation from the Carpathia
Mr. and Mrs. William E. Carter, Miss Lucille Carter and William
E. Carter, Jr., of Newport, Bryn Mawr, and 2116 Walnut
street, Philadelphia, about whom so much anxiety was felt for
the first twenty-four hours after the news of the Titanic disaster
reached the mainland, went in taxicabs to the home of William
Dickerman, at 89 Madison avenue. Mr. Dickerman is a brother-in-law
of Mr. Carter.</p>

<h3>IT WAS LIFE OR DEATH.</h3>

<p>“I kissed my husband good-bye and as he stood on the deck
I went down the side to a lifeboat. There were no seamen there.
It was life or death. I took an oar and started to row,” said Mrs.
Carter, who was formerly Miss Lucille Polk, of Baltimore, when
seen later at the Madison avenue house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter had just come from the ship, and the tears were
still in her eyes; glad tears from the welcome she had received
from her relatives, among whom was Anderson Polk, who had
come to New York to meet her. She told of being roused from
her sleep at fourteen minutes of twelve on Sunday night by the
sudden crash, of rushing out on the deck to find the chaos of
destruction quickly form itself into the decisive action of brave
men about to face their death.</p>

<p>Clasping her hands tightly she told how the men had stood
back or else helped to lower away the lifeboats, and then, kissing<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_99">{99}</a></span>
their wives, bade them a good-bye which they thought would be
forever. In brief words, tensely spoken, she told of going into
the lifeboat and taking an oar. At ten minutes past 1 o’clock
there was a sudden explosion and the giant hulk of the Titanic
blew up, rearing in the water like a spurred horse and then sinking
beneath the waves.</p>

<p>She had to pull hard with her oars in the desperate attempt
which the poorly manned lifeboat had to make to keep from
being sucked down with the diving Titanic. After minutes of
work with the desperation of death, they made their way out of
the suction and were saved. It was not until she was taken
aboard the Carpathia that she met her husband, saved because
he had to man an oar in another lifeboat.</p>

<h3>DID NOT ANTICIPATE TROUBLE.</h3>

<p>“We had a pleasant voyage from England,” began Mrs.
Carter. “The ship behaved splendidly, and we did not anticipate
any trouble at all. I had retired on Sunday night, an hour before
we struck the iceberg. The men were in the cabin smoking.
Most of them were in the smoking-room when the ship hit.</p>

<p>“The first I knew of the accident was a tremendous thump
which nearly threw me out of my berth. I realized that something
must have happened, and feared that it was a bad accident.
A moment later my husband came down to the stateroom and
told me that we had struck an iceberg.</p>

<p>“There was no confusion. I dressed myself hurriedly and
went on deck with my children. The ship was badly damaged.
The officers thought at first that she would not sink and we were
told to be calm. But it was not long before we knew that the
ship could not long stand the strain of the water which was pouring
into the bow and bearing the ship down on her forward part.</p>

<p>“Then came the time when we knew that it must either be
the lifeboats or stay on the ship and sink with her. The seamen
began to lower away the lifeboats. One after another they released
whatever machinery held them and they dropped into the
ocean. There was ice all about us and the night being compara<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_100">{100}</a></span>tively
clear we could see the floes around us when we peered
down over the side of the ship.</p>

<p>“When the boats had been lowered then it was that the time
of parting came. There was no excitement. Every one of the
men whose wives or women folk were with them took them to
the side of the ship where a lifeboat was waiting and kissed them
over the side.</p>

<p>“Major Archibald Butt remained on board and went down
with the ship. Colonel Astor also went down with the ship.
Mrs. Astor was in my boat. The Colonel took her to the side and
kissed her and saw her over the side.</p>

<p>“When I went over the side with my children and got in
the boat there were no seamen in it. Then came a few men, but
there were oars with no one to use them. The boat had been
filled with passengers and there was nothing else for me to do
but to take an oar.</p>

<h3>WARNED TO PULL AWAY FROM SHIP.</h3>

<p>“We could see now that the time of the ship had come. She
was sinking and we were warned by the cries from the men above
to pull away from the ship quickly. Mrs. Thayer, wife of the
Vice president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, was in my boat, and
she, too, took an oar.</p>

<p>“It was cold and we had no time to clothe ourselves with
warm overcoats. The rowing warmed me. We started to pull
away from the ship. We could see the dim outlines of the decks
above, but we could not recognize anybody.</p>

<p>“We had pulled our lifeboat away from the Titanic for a
distance of about a city block, that is about all, I should say&mdash;when
the Titanic seemed to shake to pieces. The ship had struck
about fourteen minutes to 12. It was ten minutes past 1 when
we saw her lunge.</p>

<p>“She had exploded. There was a rumbling noise within
her, then she gave a lurch and started to go down. We realized
what it meant. That the sinking ship would suck us under with
her. It was a moment later that the suction struck us. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_101">{101}</a></span>
all we could do to keep from being caught, so strong was the
drag down that followed the Titanic.</p>

<p>“But we pulled away at last, after straining as hard as we
could at the oars. Then we were alone in the boat, and it seemed
darker. We remained in the boat all night waiting for daylight
to come. It came at last, and when it broke over the sea we saw
ice floes all about it.</p>

<p>“It was about 8.30 o’clock when the Carpathia came into
sight. I can’t tell how I felt when I saw her. I had believed that
my husband had gone down on the ship. It was not until after
we were taken over the side of the Carpathia that I saw him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter had been compelled to take an oar in a lifeboat
that was not sufficiently manned. That is how he came to be
saved. All of the men waited for the women to go first. Mr.
Carter was among the number. When he put me into a lifeboat
he stayed back, and I had thought when I saw the ship blow up
and sink that he had gone down with her.</p>

<h3>DOES NOT DESERVE CRITICISM.</h3>

<p>“Mr. Ismay does not deserve any criticism for being saved.
He was another of those who had to man an oar in a lifeboat, so
as to get the boats out of danger by being sucked under by the
sinking Titanic.”</p>

<p>Three French survivors, Fernand Oment, Pierre Marechal,
son of the well-known French Admiral, and Paul Chevre, the
sculptor, conjointly cabled to the “Matin” a graphic narrative
of the disaster to the Titanic, in which they repeatedly insist that
more lives could have been saved if the passengers had not had
such dogged faith that the Titanic was unsinkable. Several
boats, they declared, could have carried double the number.</p>

<p>The three Frenchmen say that they were playing bridge
with a Philadelphian when a great, crunching mass of ice packed
up against the port holes. As they rushed on deck there was
much confusion, but this quickly died down. One of the officers
when questioned by a woman passenger humorously replied:</p>

<p>“Do not be afraid. We are merely cutting a whale in two.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_102">{102}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Presently the captain appeared to become somewhat nervous
and ordered all to put on life preservers. The boats were
then lowered, but only a few people stirred and several of the
boats put off half empty, one with only fifteen persons in it.</p>

<p>When the Frenchmen’s boat rowed off for half a mile the
Titanic presented a fairylike picture illuminated from stem to
stern. Then suddenly the lights began to go out and the stern
reared up high in the air. An immense clamor rose on all sides,
and during an hour anguished cries rang out.</p>

<p>It was, say the narrators, like a great chorus chanting a refrain
of death with wild obstinacy. Sometimes the cries died out
and then the tragic chorus began again more terribly and more
despairingly.</p>

<p>The narrative continues:</p>

<p>“Those shrieks pursued us and haunted us as we pulled away
in the night. Then one by one the cries ceased, and only the
noise of the sea remained. The Titanic was engulfed almost
without a murmur. Her stern quivered in a final spasm and then
disappeared.”</p>

<p>The Frenchmen and their companions suffered bitterly
from the cold. They cried out to attract attention, and a German
baron, who was with them, emptied his revolver in the air.
When finally the Carpathia appeared a feeble hurrah went up
from the small boats, every one of which moved as swiftly as
possible toward the liner.</p>

<p>The Frenchmen related tragic incidents as they were leaving
the sides of the Titanic. After all the boats had been
launched many of the passengers who had stayed behind too
long tried to embark on a collapsible raft, which worked badly.
Fifty persons climbed onto the raft, which was half filled with
water.</p>

<p>One after another the passengers on the raft were drowned,
or perished with the cold. When a body was found in the way
it was thrown overboard, and only fifteen of the fifty who had
taken refuge on the raft were saved by the Carpathia.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_103">{103}</a></span></p>

SURVIVORS’ STIRRING STORIES.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">Survivors’ Stirring Stories&mdash;How Young Thayer Was Saved&mdash;His
Father, Second Vice President of the Pennsylvania
Railroad, Drowned&mdash;Mrs. Straus’ Pathetic Death&mdash;Black
Coward Shot&mdash;Countess Aids in Rowing Boat.</p></div>

<p>Standing at the rail of the main deck of the ill-fated Titanic,
Arthur Ryerson, of Gray’s lane, Haverford, Pa., waved encouragement
to his wife as the lifeboat in which she and her three
children&mdash;John, Emily and Susan&mdash;had been placed with his
assistance glided away from the doomed ship. A few minutes
later, after the lifeboat with his loved ones had passed beyond
the range of his vision, Mr. Ryerson met death in the icy water
into which the crushed ship plunged.</p>

<p>It is now known that Mr. Ryerson might have found a place
in one of the first lifeboats to be lowered, but made no effort to
leave the ship’s deck after assuring himself that his wife and children
would be saved.</p>

<p>It was not until the Carpathia reached her dock that relatives
who were on hand to meet the survivors of the Ryerson
family knew that little “Jack” Ryerson was among the rescued.
Day by day since the first tidings of the accident to the Titanic
were published, “Jack” had been placed among the missing.</p>

<p>Perhaps of all those who came up from the Carpathia with
the impress of the tragedy upon them, the homecoming of Mrs.
Ryerson was peculiarly sad.</p>

<p>While motoring with J. Lewis Hoffman, of Radnor, Pa., on
the Main Line, on Monday a week before, Arthur L. Ryerson,
her son, was killed. His parents abandoned their plans for a
summer pleasure trip through Europe and took passage on the
first home-bound ship, which happened to be the Titanic, to at<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_104">{104}</a></span>tend
the funeral of their son. And now upon one tragedy a
second presses.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the Carpathia Mrs. Ryerson, almost too exhausted
and weak to tell of her experiences, was taken in a taxicab
to the Hotel Belmont. With her were her son “Jack” and
her two daughters, Miss Emily and Miss Susan Ryerson.</p>

<p>The young women were hysterical with grief as they walked
up from the dock, and the little lad who had witnessed such
sights of horror and tragedy clung to his mother’s hand, wide
eyed and sorrowful.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ryerson said that she and her husband were asleep
in their staterooms, as were their children, when the terrible
grating crash came and the ship foundered.</p>

<p>The women threw kimonos over their night gowns and
rushed barefooted to the deck. Master Ryerson’s nurse caught
up a few articles of the little boy’s clothing and almost as soon
as the party reached the deck they were numbered off into boats
and lowered into the sea.</p>

<h3>HARROWING AND TERRIBLE.</h3>

<p>Mrs. John M. Brown, whose husband was formerly a well-known
Philadelphian, but now lives in Boston, described her experience
on the Titanic as the “most harrowing and terrible that
any living soul could undergo.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was heart-rending to see those brave men die,” Mrs.
Brown said, half-sobbingly, after she had left the pier in a taxicab
brought by her husband.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown, for his part, said the days of agony which he
had experienced, when the lists of Titanic survivors were altered,
diminished and published incomplete, leaving him indecisive as
to his wife’s fate, was almost on a par what she had undergone.</p>

<p>In contradiction to several other statements, Mrs. Brown
declared that she saw no signs of panic or disorder on the Titanic
and did not know until later that there had been shooting on
board the vessel.</p>

<p>“I was in my berth when the crash came,” Mrs. Brown said,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_105">{105}</a></span>
“and after the first shock when I knew instinctively that the vessel
was sinking I was comparatively calm.</p>

<p>“I had hardly reached deck when an officer called to me to
enter a lifeboat. I did so, and saw the huge liner split in half,
with a pang almost as keen as if I had seen somebody die.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown said that John B. Thayer, Jr., after jumping
from the deck of the liner, clad only in pajamas, swam through
cakes of floating ice to a broken raft. He was picked up by the
boat of which Mrs. Brown was an occupant.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown said that it was about two hours after the Titanic
sank that their boat came within sight of an object bobbing
up and down in the cakes of ice, about fifty yards away.</p>

<p>Nearing, they made out the form of a boy clinging with one
leg and both arms wrapped around the piece of wreckage.
Young Thayer uttered feeble cries as they pulled alongside.</p>

<h3>LAD PULLED INTO LIFE-BOAT.</h3>

<p>The lad was pulled into the already crowded lifeboat exhausted.
With a weak, faint smile, Mrs. Brown said, the lad
collapsed.</p>

<p>Women, who were not rowing or assisting in maneuvering
the boat, by vigorous rubbing soon brought Thayer to consciousness
and shared part of their scanty attire to keep him from
dying from exposure. In the meantime the boat bobbed about
on the waves like a top, frequently striking cakes of ice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown said for several hours more they battled with
the sea before help arrived.</p>

<p>“It was a blessed sight when all saw the Carpathia heading
in our din,” she declared. “We had hopes that a ship would
come to our rescue and all on board prayed for safe deliverance.</p>

<p>“No one can realize our feeling of gratitude when the Carpathia
hoved into sight. With increased energy the men, aided
by the women, pulled on the oars. We were soon taken aboard.
Young Thayer was hurried into the hospital on board the boat
and was given stimulants and revived.</p>

<p>“Three survivors died soon after; they were buried at sea.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_106">{106}</a></span>
Mrs. Brown said that Mrs. John Jacob Astor, the wife of Colonel
John Jacob Astor, who proved himself a hero, was also an occupant
of her boat.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Astor was frantic when she learned that her husband
had gone with the Titanic, but between sobs said he died a hero,”
Mrs. Brown said.</p>

<p>“The colonel kissed her and pushing his bride to the side of
the ship told her to hurry to the lifeboats awaiting below.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Astor refused to listen to her husband’s entreaties
until he assured her that he would follow on the next boat, although
all the time he knew that he would sink.”</p>

<p>“The following horrors have never left me, day or night,”
Mrs. Brown continued.</p>

<h3>DEAD BODIES OF BRAVE MEN.</h3>

<p>“I saw dead bodies of brave men float past the lifeboats. I
heard the death cries of women and saw the terrible desolation
of the wreck by dawn.”</p>

<p>In the boat with Mrs. Brown were her two sisters, Mrs.
Robert Cornell, wife of Judge Robert Cornell, and Mrs. S. P.
Appleton.</p>

<p>They followed each other down the long, roughly constructed
rope ladder, a distance of more than fifty feet, into the
tenth lifeboat. All were thinly clad. They had retired for the
night and were tumbled from their berths when the crash came.</p>

<p>When the Titanic sank and the first news came of the disaster,
there appeared in the list of first cabin passengers the name
of “Washington Logue.” Until J. Washington Logue, of Philadelphia,
could be found to explain that he was not on the high
seas, many of his friends feared that he had been on the Titanic.</p>

<p>When he landed from the Carpathia, Washington Dodge, of
San Francisco, was told how his name had been confused in the
wireless reports from the Olympic. He said he congratulated
Mr. Logue on having been no closer to disaster than this.</p>

<p>Mr. Dodge, who is a millionaire; Mrs. Dodge and their four-year-old
son, Washington Dodge, Jr., were among the first to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_107">{107}</a></span>
land on the dock from the Cunarder. Mr. Dodge carried a life
preserver of the Titanic as a memento.</p>

<p>“Nearly all the passengers had retired when the crash came,
about twenty minutes passed 10 o’clock,” said Mr. Dodge. “The
liner was struck on the starboard side, near the bow. The bow,
it seemed, withstood the crash, but water rushed into several
compartments at the same time.”</p>

<p>“There was complete order among the passengers and crew.
We really didn’t think there was any danger. We were assured
that the ship would float and that there were plenty vessels in
the reach of wireless to come to our aid if that should become
necessary.</p>

<p>“Then the sinking of the Titanic by the head began and the
crew was ordered to man the boats. There was no panic. The
officers told the men to stand back and they obeyed. A few men
were ordered into the boats. Two men who attempted to rush
beyond the restraint line were shot down by an officer who then
turned the revolver on himself. I could see Mrs. Isador Straus.
She clung to her husband and refused to leave him.</p>

<h3>FLOATED FOR FOUR HOURS.</h3>

<p>“We floated for four hours until we were picked up. Mr.
Ismay left the Titanic on a small boat.</p>

<p>“I did not see the iceberg. When we got into the boat she
was gone.</p>

<p>“As the Titanic went down, Major Archibald Butt was
standing on the deck. I saw him.”</p>

<p>The body of one black coward, a member of the Titanic’s
crew, lies alone in the wireless “coop” on the highest deck of the
shadowy bulk of what was once the world’s greatest ship two
miles down in the dark of unplumbed ocean depths. There is a
bullet hole in the back of his skull.</p>

<p>This man was shot by Harold Bride, the second wireless
man aboard the Titanic, and assistant to the heroic Phillips, chief
operator, who lost his life. Bride shot him from behind just at
the instant that the coward was about to plunge a knife into<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_108">{108}</a></span>
Phillips’ back and rob him of the life preserver which was strapped
under his arm pits. He died instantly and Phillips, all unconscious
at that instant that Bride was saving his life, had but
a brief little quarter of an hour added to his span by the act of
his assistant, and then went down to death.</p>

<p>This grim bit of tragedy, only a little interlude in the whole
terrible procession of horror aboard the sinking boat, occurred
high above the heads of the doomed men and women who waited
death in the bleak galleys of the decks.</p>

<p>“I had to do it,” was the way Bride put it.</p>

<p>“I could not let that coward die a decent sailor’s death, so I
shot him down and left him alone there in the wireless coop to
go down with the hulk of the ship. He is there yet, the only
one in the wireless room where Phillips, a real hero, worked
madly to save the lives of two thousand and more people.”</p>

<h3>NEW YORK PHYSICIAN’S ESCAPE.</h3>

<p>Miss Alice Farnan Leader, a New York physician, escaped
from the Titanic on the same boat which carried the Countess
Rothes.</p>

<p>“The Countess is an expert oarswoman,” said Dr. Leader,
“and thoroughly at home on the water. She took command
of our boat, when it was found that the seamen who had been
placed at the oars could not row skilfully. Several of the women
took their places with the Countess at the oars and rowed in
turns while the weak and unskilled stewards sat quietly in one
end of the boat.”</p>

<p>“The men were the heroes,” said Mrs. Churchill Candee, of
Washington, one of the survivors, “and among the bravest and
most heroic, as I recall, were Mr. Widener, Mr. Thayer and
Colonel Astor. They thought only of the saving of the women
and went down with the Titanic, martyrs to their manhood.</p>

<p>“I saw Mr. and Mrs. Isador Straus on the deck of the Titanic
as I was lowered into one of the lifeboats. Mrs. Straus refused
to leave the ship unless her husband could accompany her. They
were on the top deck, and I heard her say she would not leave<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_109">{109}</a></span>
her husband. She went down with him as she had lived and
traveled with him. Life without him did not concern her, seemingly.
‘I’ve always stayed with my husband, so why should I
leave him now? I’ll die with him,’ I heard her say.</p>

<p>“Captain Smith, I think, sacrificed safety in a treacherous
ice field for speed. He was trying to make 570 miles for the day,
I heard. The captain, who had stood waist deep on the deck of
the Titanic as she sank, jumped as the ship went down, but he
was drowned. All of the men had bravely faced their doom for
the women and children.</p>

<p>“The ship settled slowly, the lights going out deck after
deck as the water reached them. The final plunge, however,
was sudden and accompanied by explosions, the effect of which
was a horrible sight. Victims standing on the upper deck toward
the stern were hurled into the air and fell into the treacherous
ice-covered sea. Some were rescued, but most of them
perished. I cannot help recalling again that Mr. Widener and
Mr. Thayer and Colonel Astor died manfully.</p>

<h3>TWO DISTINCT SHOCKS.</h3>

<p>“The ice pack which we encountered,” explained Mrs. Candee,
“was fifty-six miles long, I have since heard. When we
collided with the mountainous mass it was nearly midnight Sunday.
There were two distinct shocks, each shaking the ship
violently, but fear did not spread among the passengers immediately.
They seemed not to realize what had happened, but the
captain and other officers did not endeavor to minimize the
danger.</p>

<p>“The first thing I recall was one of the crew appearing with
pieces of ice in his hands. He said he had gathered them from
the bow of the boat. Some of the passengers were inclined to
believe he was joking. But soon the situation dawned on all of
us. The lifeboats were ordered lowered and manned and the
word went around that women and children were to be taken
off first. The men stood back as we descended to the frail craft<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_110">{110}</a></span>
or assisted us to disembark. I now recall that huge Woolner
Bjomstrom was among the heroic men.”</p>

<p>“The Philadelphia women behaved heroically.”</p>

<p>This was the way Mrs. Walter B. Stephenson, of Haverford,
a survivor of the wreck of the fated Titanic, began her
brief but graphic account of the disaster at her home in Haverford,
which she reached on the special train that brought Mrs.
John B. Thayer and others over from New York.</p>

<p>Worn by hours of terrible uncertainty on the frail lifeboats
in the open sea, almost distracted by the ordeal of waiting for
news of those left behind on the big liner, Mrs. Stephenson bore
herself as did the women whom she described heroically indeed.</p>

<p>She told how John B. Thayer, Jr., fell overboard when the
boats were launched, and how he was saved from the death that
his father met, by the crew of the lifeboat. She described tersely,
to linger sadly as she finished with the words, “But we never
saw Mr. Thayer, Sr., at all.”</p>

<h3>OCCUPANTS OF THE SAME BOAT.</h3>

<p>Mrs. Thayer, Mrs. J. Boulton Earnshaw, of Mt. Airy, and
Mrs. George D. Widener were occupants of the same boat that
carried Mrs. Stephenson to safety, and, like Mrs. Stephenson,
they witnessed the final plunge of the Titanic.</p>

<p>“We were far off,” said Mrs. Stephenson, “but we could see
a huge dark mass behind us. Then it disappeared.” That was
all she could tell of the fate of those left on board.</p>

<p>“Then it disappeared,” she paused and her voice choked.
“We weren’t sure but what we might have been mistaken. A
lingering hope remained until long after the Carpathia picked
us up. Then the wireless told the terrible tidings. We were the
sole survivors.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Stephenson wore the same dress that she hastily
donned when the crash occurred. It was a simple gown of dark
texture, showing the wear in its crumpled shape. Over it she
had managed to throw a cape, and to the covering she clung, as
if yet fearful of the icy blasts of the Northern Ocean.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_111">{111}</a></span></p>

<p>Conveyed in a taxicab to the Pennsylvania Railroad Station
from the Cunard wharf, Mrs. Stephenson alighted, hastened
across the train shed and into a waiting elevator. She walked
unaided. Relatives who had rushed from Philadelphia to convey
her in safety, were solicitous for her welfare, but she assured
them that she was well.</p>

<p>“And she is well,” said T. DeWitt Cuyler, a director of the
Pennsylvania Railroad who met the train. “She has borne up
remarkably under the strain.”</p>

<p>“I was wakened in my cabin by the shock,” Mrs. Stephenson
began. “It was nearly 12 o’clock, but I cannot be sure. The
shock was great, but not as great as the one I experienced in the
San Francisco earthquake. I was staying in the St. Francis
Hotel at the time of the earthquake. Even this terrible disaster
cannot shake the memory of that night from my mind.</p>

<h3>ASSURANCE OF NO IMMEDIATE DANGER.</h3>

<p>“I rose hastily from my berth and was about to hasten to
the deck when my maid assured me that there was no immediate
danger and that I would have time to dress; I put on this dress
that I am wearing and threw a cape around my shoulders. Then
I went on deck.</p>

<p>“Scarcely had I gotten out in the air when an officer ordered
me to don a life belt. I returned to the cabin to buckle one
around me. When I returned I heard the order to man the lifeboats.
There was no disorder. The crew was under perfect
discipline. Quickly and without any excitement I was lifted
into a lifeboat. Beside me I found Mrs. Thayer, Mrs. Earnshaw
and Mrs. Widener. Like myself they had no clothing except
what they wore.</p>

<p>“John B. Thayer, Jr., was with us. As the boat was lowered
by the davits, he slipped and fell into the water; luckily he wore
a life belt and was kept afloat until a sailor lifted him safely
aboard. We never saw Mr. Thayer, Sr., at all.</p>

<p>“As the boat pushed off from the ship Mrs. Widener collapsed.
She was finally revived. The Philadelphia women be<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_112">{112}</a></span>haved
heroically. They stood up splendidly under the suspense,
which was terrible. The sailors rowed our boat some distance
away. We thought we saw the Titanic sink, but we couldn’t be
sure. Behind us we could see a dark shape. Then it disappeared.
We despaired of any others being saved, but some hope
remained until long after the Carpathia had picked us up. Then
the wireless told the sad tale.</p>

<h3>WAIFS FROM TITANIC RESTORED TO MOTHER’S ARMS.</h3>

<p>Lola and Momon, the little waifs of the Titanic disaster,
snatched from the sea and kept for a month in a big, strange land,
were clasped in the arms of their mother Mme. Marcelle Navratil,
who arrived in New York, on May 16, from France on the White
Star liner Oceanic.</p>

<p>Hurrying down the gangplank, after kindly customs officials
had facilitated her landing, Mme. Navratil, who is an Italian, 24
years old, of remarkable beauty, rushed to Miss Margaret Hays,
the rescuer of the two little boys, who, with her father, was waiting
on the pier. They took her in a cab to the Children’s Society
rooms, and there she was reunited with her children.</p>

<p>The little boys, four and two years old, were thrust into one
of the last of the lifeboats to leave the sinking Titanic by an
excited Frenchmen, who asked that they be cared for. A steward
told him he could not enter the boat and he said he did not want
to, but must save his boys.</p>

<p>Arriving in New York on the Carpathia, Miss Hays at first
could learn nothing of the children’s identity, and she planned to
care for them. Then developed another chapter of the weird story
of the disaster in the ice fields. The Frenchman’s body was
recovered and taken to Halifax, where it was found that he was
booked on the passenger list under the name of “Hoffman.”</p>

<p>Cable messages to France brought the information that Mme.
Navratil’s husband, from whom she was separated, had kidnapped
her children and said he was going to America. He often used
the name “Hoffman.” Photographs of the boys were sent to
Mme. Navratil in France, and she identified them as her children.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_113">{113}</a></span></p>

Daughter Hears of His Death&mdash;Philadelphia Millionaires’
Heroism&mdash;Last to See Widener Alive&mdash;Major
Butt Dies a Soldier’s Death.</p></div>

<p>The heroism of the majority of the men who went down to
death with the Titanic has been told over and over again. How
John Jacob Astor kissed his wife and saluted death as he looked
squarely into its face; the devotion of Mrs. Isidor Straus to her
aged husband and the willingness with which she went to her
doom with his loving arms pressed tenderly around her, the tales
of life sacrificed that women might be saved brought some need
of comfort to the stricken.</p>

<p>G. A. Brayton, of Los Angeles, Cal, says: “John Jacob
Astor went to one of the officers and told them who he was, and
asked to go in the lifeboat with his wife. The officer told him
he could not go in the lifeboat. Astor then kissed his wife good-bye
and she was put in the lifeboat. Astor said: ‘I resign myself
to my fate’ and saluted in farewell.”</p>

<p>“Colonel Astor and Major Archibald Butt died together on
the bridge of the ill-fated ship,” said Dr. Washington Dodge,
of San Francisco, one of the survivors. “I saw them standing
there side by side. I was in one of the last boats, and I could not
mistake them. Earlier during the desperate struggle to get the
boats cleared I had seen them both at work quieting passengers
and helping the officers maintain order.</p>

<p>“A few minutes before the last I saw Colonel Astor help<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_114">{114}</a></span>
his wife, who appeared ill, into a boat, and I saw him wave his
hand to her and smile as the boat pulled away.”</p>

<p>Before the lifeboats left the ship, not far from the woman
who would not let her husband meet death alone, Colonel Astor
stood supporting the figure of his young bride, says another survivor.
A boat was being filled with women. Colonel Astor
helped his wife to a place in it. The boat was not filled, and there
seemed no more women near it. Quietly the Colonel turned to
the second officer, who was superintending the loading.</p>

<p>“May I go with my wife? She is ill,” he asked. The Officer
nodded. The man of millions got into the boat. The crew were
about to cast off the falls. Suddenly the Colonel sprang to his
feet, shouting to them to wait. He had seen a woman running
toward the boat. Leaping over the rail, he helped her to the
place he had occupied.</p>

<h3>TRIED TO CLIMB FROM THE BOAT.</h3>

<p>Mrs. Astor screamed and tried to climb from the boat. The
Colonel restrained her. He bent and tenderly patted her
shoulder.</p>

<p>“The ladies first, dear heart,” he was heard to say.</p>

<p>Then quietly he saluted the second officer and turned to
help in lowering more boats.</p>

<p>Miss Margaret Hayes gave another version of the manner
in which Colonel Astor met his death: “Colonel Astor, with his
wife, came out on deck as I was being assisted into a lifeboat,”
said Miss Hayes, “and both got into another boat. Colonel
Astor had his arms about his wife and assisted her into the boat.
At the time there were no women waiting to get into the boats,
and the ship’s officer at that point invited Colonel Astor to get
into the boat with his wife. The Colonel, after looking around
and seeing no women, got into the boat, and his wife threw her
arms about him.</p>

<p>“The boat in which Colonel Astor and his wife were sitting
was about to be lowered when a woman came running out of
the companionway. Raising his hand, Colonel Astor stopped<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_115">{115}</a></span>
the preparations to lower his boat and, stepping out, assisted the
woman into the seat he had occupied.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Astor cried out, and wanted to get out of the boat
with her husband, but the Colonel patted her on the back and
said something in a low tone of voice.”</p>

<p>A nephew of Senator Clark, of Butte, Montana, said Astor
stood by the after rail looking after the lifeboats until the Titanic
went down.</p>

<p>Brayton says: “Captain Smith stood on the bridge until he
was washed off by a wave. He swam back, stood on the bridge
again and was there when the Titanic went to the bottom.”
Brayton says that Henry B. Harris, the theatrical manager, “tried
to get on a lifeboat with his wife, but the second officer held him
back with a gun. A third-class passenger who tried to climb in
the boats was shot and killed by a steward. This was the only
shooting on board I know of.”</p>

<p>Another account of Captain Smith’s death is as follows:</p>

<h3>CAPTAIN SMITH DIED A HERO</h3>

<p>Captain Smith died a hero’s death. He went to the bottom
of the ocean without effort to save himself. His last acts were
to place a five-year-old child on the last lifeboat in reach, then
cast his life belt to the ice ridden waters and resign to the fate
that tradition down the ages observed as a strict law.</p>

<p>It was left to a fireman of the Titanic to tell the tale of the
death of Captain Smith and the last message he left behind him.
This man had gone down with the vessel and was clinging to a
piece of wreckage about half an hour before he finally joined
several members of the Titanic’s company on the bottom of a
boat which was floating among other wreckage.</p>

<p>Harry Senior, the fireman, with his eight or nine companions
in distress, had just managed to get a firm hold on the
upturned boat, when they saw the Titanic rearing preparatory
to her final plunge. At that moment, according to the fireman’s
tale, Captain Smith jumped into the sea from the promenade
deck of the Titanic with an infant clutched tenderly in his arms.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_116">{116}</a></span></p>

<p>It only took a few strokes to bring him to the upturned lifeboat,
where a dozen hands were stretched out to take the little
child from his arms and drag him to safety.</p>

<p>“Captain Smith was dragged on the upturned boat,” said
the fireman. “He had on a life buoy and a life preserver. He
clung there a moment and then he slid off again. For a second
time he was dragged from the icy water. Then he took off his
life preserver, tossed the life buoy on the inky waters and slipped
into the water again with the words; ‘I will follow the ship.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>At that time there was only a circle of troubled water and
some wreckage to show the spot where the biggest of all ocean
steamers had sunk out of sight.</p>

<p>“No,” said the stoker, as he waved a sandwich above his
head, holding a glass of beer in the other hand, “Captain Smith
never shot himself. I saw what he did. He went down with that
ship. I’ll stake my life on that.”</p>

<h3>THE SAME STORY REPEATED.</h3>

<p>Oddly enough, a Swedish stoker and survivor, named Oscar
Ingstrom, at another hotel in the same vicinity, gave to one of
the most prominent Swedish newspaper men in New York City
practically the same tale that Senior told.</p>

<p>Wilson Potter, whose mother, Mrs. Thomas Potter, Jr.,
of Mt. Airy, Pa., was one of the survivors, told how she had
urged Colonel Astor and his wife to leave the Titanic before the
vessel went down.</p>

<p>“My mother was one of the first to leave the Titanic,” he
said. “As the lifeboats were filling up, she called to Colonel
and Mrs. Astor to come aboard. Mrs. Astor waved her off, exclaiming,
‘We are safer here than in that little boat.’</p>

<p>“Hundreds of other passengers thought the same way. So
much so, that the first lifeboat, which my mother boarded, was
large enough to hold forty persons besides the crew; still only
ten came along. All were of the opinion that the Titanic would
remain afloat until aid came from another steamer.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_117">{117}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Mr. Potter also related another version of how J. B. Thayer,
Jr., and his mother were rescued.</p>

<p>“As the crash came Mrs. Thayer fainted. Young Mr.
Thayer carried her to one of the lifeboats. As she was lifted in
father and son lost their hold and fell between the sinking steamer
and the lifeboat.</p>

<p>“After struggling in the water for several minutes Young
Mr. Thayer was picked up by a raft. Two hours later the raft
was found by the Carpathia.”</p>

<p>A third remarkable escape as related by Mr. Potter was
that of Richard Norris Williams.</p>

<p>“Mr. Williams remained on the stern of the Titanic,” said
Mr. Potter. “He says the stern of the boat went down, then
came up. As it started to go down a second time Mr. Williams
says he dived off and swam to a raft, which was picked up two
hours later by the Carpathia.”</p>

<h3>UTTERLY EXHAUSTED FROM HER EXPERIENCE.</h3>

<p>When utterly exhausted from her experience, Mrs. John
Jacob Astor was declared by Nicholas Biddle, a trustee of the
Astor estate, to be in no danger whatever. Her physicians,
however, have given orders that neither Mrs. Astor nor her
maid, who was saved with her, be permitted to talk about the
disaster.</p>

<p>On landing from the Carpathia, the young bride, widowed
by the Titanic’s sinking, told members of her family what she
could recall of the circumstances of the disaster. Of how Colonel
Astor met his death, she has no definite conception. She
recalled, she thought, that in the confusion, as she was about
to be put into one of the boats, the Colonel was standing by her
side. After that, as Mr. Biddle recounted her narrative, she
had no very clear recollection of the happenings until the boats
were well clear of the sinking steamer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Astor, it appears, left in one of the last boats which
got away from the ship. It was her belief that all the women<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_118">{118}</a></span>
who wished to go had been taken off. Her impression was that
the boat she left in had room for at least fifteen more persons.</p>

<p>The men, for some reason, which, as she recalled it, she
could not and does not now understand, did not seem to be at
all anxious to leave the ship. Almost every one seemed dazed.</p>

<p>“I hope he is alive somewhere. Yes, I cannot think anything
else,” the young woman said of her husband to her father
as she left the latter to go to the Astor home, according to some
who overheard her parting remarks.</p>

<p>The chief steerage steward of the Titanic, who came in on
the Carpathia, says that he saw John Jacob Astor standing by
the life ladder as the passengers were being embarked. His
wife was beside him, the steward said. The Colonel left her to
go to the purser’s office for a moment, and that was the last
he saw of him.</p>

<h3>WRITER GOES DOWN WITH THE SHIP.</h3>

<p>Mrs. May Futrelle, whose husband, Jacques Futrelle, the
writer, went down with the ship, was met here by her daughter,
Miss Virginia Futrelle, who was brought to New York from the
Convent of Notre Dame in Baltimore.</p>

<p>Miss Futrelle had been told that her father had been picked
up by another steamer. Mrs. Charles Copeland, of Boston, a
sister of the writer, who also met Mrs. Futrelle, was under the
same impression.</p>

<p>“I am so happy that father is safe, too,” declared Miss
Futrelle, as her mother clasped her in her arms. It was some
time before Mrs. Futrelle could compose herself.</p>

<p>“Where is Jack?” Miss Copeland asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Futrelle, afraid to let her daughter know the truth,
said: “Oh! he is on another ship.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Copeland guessed the truth and became hysterical.
Then the writer’s daughter broke down.</p>

<p>“Jack died like a hero,” Mrs. Futrelle said, when the party
became composed. “He was in the smoking-room when the
crash came&mdash;the noise of the smash was terrific&mdash;and I was go<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_119">{119}</a></span>ing
to bed. I was hurled from my feet by the impact. I hardly
found myself when Jack came rushing into the stateroom.</p>

<p>“The boat is going down, get dressed at once!” he shouted.
When we reached the deck everything was in the wildest confusion.
The screams of women and the shrill orders of the
officers were drowned intermittently by the tremendous vibrations
of the Titanic’s bass foghorn.</p>

<p>“The behavior of the men was magnificent. They stood
back without murmuring and urged the women and children
into the lifeboats. A few cowards tried to scramble into the
boats, but they were quickly thrown back by the others. Let
me say now that the only men who were saved were those who
sneaked into the lifeboats or were picked up after the Titanic
sank.</p>

<p>“I did not want to leave Jack, but he assured me that there
were boats enough for all and that he would be rescued later.</p>

<h3>LIFTED INTO A LIFE-BOAT AND KISSED.</h3>

<p>“Hurry up, May, you’re keeping the others waiting,” were
his last words, as he lifted me into a lifeboat and kissed me
good-bye. I was in one of the last lifeboats to leave the ship.
We had not put out many minutes when the Titanic disappeared.
I almost thought, as I saw her sink beneath the water,
that I could see Jack, standing where I had left him and waving
at me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Futrelle said she saw the parting of Colonel John
Jacob Astor and his young bride. Mrs. Astor was frantic. Her
husband had to jump into the lifeboat four times and tell her
that he would be rescued later. After the fourth time, Mrs. Futrelle
said, he jumped back on the deck of the sinking ship and
the lifeboat bearing his bride made off.</p>

<p>George D. Widener and his son, Harry Elkins Widener,
lost in the wreck of the Titanic, died the death of heroes. They
stood back that the weaker might have a chance of being saved.</p>

<p>Mrs. Widener, one of the last women to leave the ship,
fought to die with her husband and her son. She would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_120">{120}</a></span>
succeeded probably had not sailors literally torn her from her
husband and forced her on to a life-raft.</p>

<p>As she descended the ladder at the ship’s side, compelled to
leave despite her frantic, despairing pleas, she called to Mr.
Widener and to her son pitifully:</p>

<p>“Oh, my God!” she cried. “Good-bye! George! Harry!
Good-bye! Good-bye! Oh, God! this is awful!” And that was
the last she saw of her husband and of her son, who waved a
brave farewell as she disappeared down the ladder.</p>

<p>Mr. Widener, according to James B. McGough, 708 West
York street, Philadelphia, a buyer for the Gimbel store, one of
those rescued, was as calm and collected, except at the time of
the final parting from his wife, as though he were “taking a walk
on Broad street.”</p>

<h3>HELPED WOMEN AND CHILDREN.</h3>

<p>The financier’s son, too, was calm. The two men helped
the women and the children to make their escape, but always
stood back themselves when a boat or raft was launched. As
soon as the vessel had struck the iceberg Mr. and Mrs. Widener
had sought out Captain Smith.</p>

<p>“What is the outlook?” Mr. Widener was heard to inquire.</p>

<p>“It is extremely serious,” was the quick reply. “Please
keep cool and do what you can to help us.” And this is what
Mr. Widener did.</p>

<p>Mr. McGough, when he returned to his home, contributed
to the several versions of the escape of John B. Thayer, Jr., son
of John B. Thayer, second Vice president of the Pennsylvania
Railroad, who was lost. One version was that the boy jumped
from the Titanic just as she sank, and that he swam about
among big cakes of ice until taken aboard a lifeboat.</p>

<p>Mr. McGough in his account of the lad’s rescue says the boy
jumped as the vessel sank, but that he alighted near a life-raft,
to which, half frozen, he clung until taken aboard a boat.</p>

<p>Another statement by Mr. McGough was that when a man,
presumably an Associated Press correspondent, boarded the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_121">{121}</a></span>
Carpathia off Cape Cod, and tried to wireless a message ashore
a ship officer seized it and threw it into the ocean.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago Mr. McGough was sent abroad on a purchasing
trip for his firm. With him were J. D. Flynn, of New
York, formerly of Philadelphia, and N. P. Calderhead, also a
former Philadelphian.</p>

<p>When the gang plank was thrown down from the Carpathia,
Mr. McGough was the first passenger from the ill-starred
Titanic to land, waiting for him were his wife, Mrs. Mary McGough,
and his three brothers, Philip A., Thomas and Andrew
McGough, all of 252 South Seventh street, Philadelphia. His
wife saw him first. Stretching out her arms, she threw herself
from the police lines toward him, and in a moment he had her
clasped in his embrace.</p>

<h3>SENDS A MESSAGE TO HIS MOTHER.</h3>

<p>Afterward he rushed through the crowd and took a motor
car to the home of a relative. Thence he went to the Imperial
Hotel. From the hotel he sent a message to his mother at 252
South Seventh street.</p>

<p>“I am here, safe,” the message read.</p>

<p>“The collision which caused the loss of the Titanic,” Mr.
McGough said, “occurred about 11.40 o’clock. I had an outer
state-room on the side toward the iceberg against which the ship
crashed. Flynn who occupied the room with me, had just gone
to bed. Calderhead was in bed in a stateroom adjoining.</p>

<p>“When the crash came, I ran to the porthole. I saw the
ice pressed close against the side of the ship. Chunks of it were
ground off, and they fell into the window. I happened to glance
at my watch, and it showed me exactly the hour.</p>

<p>“I knew that something was seriously wrong, and hastily
got into my clothes. I took time, also, to get my watch and
money. Flynn, in the meantime, had run over to Calderhead’s
stateroom and had awakened him. When I had dressed I ran
outside.</p>

<p>“I saw the iceberg. The boat deck stood about ninety feet<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_122">{122}</a></span>
out of the water and the berg towered above us for at least fifty
feet. I judge the berg stood between 140 and 150 feet out of the
water.</p>

<p>“Many of the women on board, I am sure, did not leave
their staterooms at once. They stayed there, at least for a time.
I believe that many of them did not awaken to their danger until
near the last.</p>

<p>“One statement I want to correct, the lights did not go out,
at least not while I was on board. When I ran to the deck I
heard Captain Smith order that the air chambers be examined.
An effort was made to work the doors closing the compartments,
but to no avail. When the ship ran upon the iceberg, the sharp-pointed
berg cut through both thicknesses of the bottom and left
it in such a position that it filled rapidly.</p>

<h3>MIGHT HAVE PERISHED.</h3>

<p>“I remember that it was a beautiful night. There was no
wind and the sea was calm. But for this it is certain that when
the boats were launched most all of us would have perished in
the ice-covered sea. At first the captain ordered the hatches over
the steerage fastened down. This was to prevent the hysterical
passengers in that part of the ship rushing to the deck and
increasing the panic. Before we left, however, those passengers
were released.</p>

<p>“Two sailors were put into each of the boats. When the
boats were lowered the women hung back. They feared to go
down the long, steep ladder to the water. Seeing them hesitate,
I cried: ‘Someone has to be first,’ and started down the ladder.</p>

<p>“I had hardly started before I regretted I had not waited on
deck. But I feel if I had not led the way the women would not
have started and the death list would have been much larger.
Flynn and Calderhead led the way into other boats.</p>

<p>“It was only a short time before the boat was filled. We had
fifty-five in our boat, nearly all of them women. We had entered
the craft so hastily that we did not take time to get a light.</p>

<p>“For a time we bobbed about on the ocean. Then we start<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_123">{123}</a></span>ed
to row slowly away. I shall never forget the screams that
flowed over the ocean toward us from the sinking ship. At the
end there was a mad rush and scramble.</p>

<p>“It was fearfully hard on the women. Few of them were
completely dressed. Some wore only their night gowns, with
some light wrapper or kimono over them. The air was pitilessly
cold.</p>

<p>“There were so few men in the boat the women had to row.
This was good for some of them, as it kept their blood in circulation,
but even then it was the most severe experience for
them imaginable. Some of them were half-crazed with grief or
terror. Several became ill from the exposure.</p>

<p>“I saw Mr. Widener just before I left, and afterward, while
we were rowing away from the vessel I had a good glimpse of
him. He appeared as calm and collected as though he were taking
a walk on Broad st. When the rush for the boats began
he and his son Harry, stood back.</p>

<h3>SHIP GOES DOWN AT 2.30 O’CLOCK.</h3>

<p>“At the end sailors had to tear Mrs. Widener from him, and
she went down the ladder, calling to him pitifully. The ship
went down at 2.20 o’clock exactly. The front end went down
gradually. We saw no men shot, but just before the finish we
heard several shots.</p>

<p>“I was told that Captain Smith or one of the officers shot
himself on the bridge just before the Titanic went under. I
heard also that several men had been killed as they made a final
rush for the boats, trying to cut off the women and children.</p>

<p>“While we were floating around the sailors set off some
redfire, which illuminated the ocean for miles around. This was
a signal of distress. Unfortunately there was no one near
enough to answer in time.</p>

<p>“John B. Thayer, Jr., was saved after he had gone down
with the ship. Just as the vessel took the plunge he leaped over
the side. He struck out for a life raft and reached it. There he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_124">{124}</a></span>
clung for several hours until, half-frozen, he was taken into one
of the boats which was a trifle less crowded than the others.</p>

<p>“For six hours we bobbed around in the ocean. We rowed
over to a boat that was provided with a light, and tied the two
small craft together. Finally daylight came, and the sun rose
in a clear sky. There we were, a little fleet, alone in the limitless
ocean, with the ice cakes tossing about on all sides.</p>

<p>“It was after 8 o’clock in the morning when we saw the
masts of a steamship coming up over the horizon. It was the
most blessed sight our eyes ever saw. It meant an end to the
physical suffering, a relief to the strain under which we had been
laboring. Many broke down when they saw it.</p>

<p>“The ship, of course, was the Carpathia. While it was
hurrying toward us the crew and passengers had made the most
generous preparations for us. When they took us on board they
had blankets, clothing, food and warm liquids all ready. Their
physicians were ready to care for the sick. The passengers gave
up their warm beds to us.</p>

<h3>BUMPED INTO FLOATING BODIES.</h3>

<p>“During the time we were in the water we bumped frequently
into the bodies that floated about us. A great many of the men
jumped into the water before the boat sank, and they were their
bodies that we struck.”</p>

<p>D. H. Bishop, a rich lumber man of Dowagaic, Mich., who
with his wife, was returning from a bridal trip to Egypt, is the
last person known to have seen George D. Widener alive. Mr.
Bishop said:</p>

<p>“My wife and I had just retired when we heard the jar and
felt a decided tilt of the ship. I got up and started to investigate,
but soon became reassured and went back to bed. A few minutes
later we heard calls to put on life belts.</p>

<p>“My wife felt very alarmed and kneeled to pray. She said
she knew we would be lost, though at that time there was no
reason to think so, and she remarked: ‘What is the use bothering
with jewelry if we are going to die?’ Accordingly she left<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_125">{125}</a></span>
in her stateroom jewelry worth about $11,000, but strangely
enough insisted upon me running back and getting her muff.</p>

<p>“As we came up the stairway we met Captain Smith and
Colonel John Jacob Astor talking hurriedly. What they said
I do not know. When we got on deck there were not more than
fifty people there and no one seemed excited and no one appeared
to want to get into the lifeboats, though urged to do so. Mrs.
Bishop and I were literally lifted into the first lifeboat.</p>

<p>“At that time I observed Mr. and Mrs. Widener, and I saw
the former leave his wife as she was getting into the lifeboat
and, accompanied by his son, go toward the stairway. I did not
see them again, as our lifeboat with only twenty-eight persons
in it and only half-manned, was lowered over the side at that
moment. An instant later there was an apparent rush for the
lifeboats and as we rowed away they came over the side with
great rapidity.</p>

<p>“Before we were a hundred yards away men were jumping
overboard, and when we were a mile away the ship went down
with cries from the men and women aboard that were heart-rending.</p>

<p>“There is nothing to say concerning the blame, except that
I do know that icebergs were known to be in our vicinity and
that it was the subject of much talk that the Titanic was out for
a record. Captain Smith was dining with J. Bruce Ismay, managing
director of the White Star Line, and of course was not on
the bridge. It was rumored on the Carpathia that Captain
Smith tried to save himself in a lifeboat at the last minute, but
of this I know nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_126">{126}</a></span></p>

<p>From William E. Carter, Bryn Mawr, Pa., who, with his
wife and two children, Lucille and William E. Carter, Jr., was
saved from the wreck of the Titanic, it was learned today that
the three women probably most notable among the survivors
were in the same lifeboat. They were Mrs. John Jacob Astor,
Mrs. George D. Widener and Mrs. John B. Thayer. In the
same boat were Mrs. Carter and her two children.</p>

<p>Colonel Astor, Mr. Thayer, Mr. Widener and Mr. Carter
separated as soon as the ladies were safely in the lifeboats, and
Mr. Carter never saw the three men again.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter was a passenger on the lifeboat in which J. Bruce
Ismay, managing director of the White Star Line, made his
escape from the sinking liner. Mr. Carter declared that the boat
was the last to leave the starboard side of the Titanic and was
nearly the last which left the vessel.</p>

<p>When entered by Mr. Carter and Mr. Ismay the boat was
occupied entirely by women of the third cabin. Every woman
on the starboard side of the vessel had been sent off in lifeboats
when Mr. Ismay and he got into the boat, Mr. Carter said.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter and his family were staying for a few days at
the home of his brother-in-law, William C. Dickerman, 809
Madison ave., New York. Mr. Carter expressed the greatest
admiration for the discipline maintained by the officers of the
Titanic, and voiced the opinion that Mr. Ismay should not be
held open to criticism.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_127">{127}</a></span></p>

<p>“If there had been another woman to go, neither Mr. Ismay
nor myself would have gotten into the boat. There can be no
criticism of Mr. Ismay’s action.”</p>

<p>In describing his experience Mr. Carter said he had urged
Harry Elkins Widener to go with him to the starboard side of
the vessel. Young Mr. Widener, thinking that there was no immediate
danger, remarked that he would take his chances on the
vessel.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter said he was in the smoking room of the Titanic
when the crash came. “I was talking to Major Butt, Clarence
Moore and Harry Widener,” he explained. “It was just seventeen
minutes to 12 o’clock.</p>

<p>“Although there was quite a jar, I thought the trouble was
slight. I believe it was the immense size of the Titanic which
brought many of the passengers to believe there was no danger.
I went on deck to see what had happened. Almost as I reached
the deck the engines were stopped.</p>

<h3>VESSEL LISTS TO PORT.</h3>

<p>“I hurried down to see about my family and found they were
all in bed. Just then the vessel listed a little to port, and I told
my wife and children they had better get up and dress.</p>

<p>“Just then orders were issued for everyone to get on life
preservers. When we came out on the deck boats were being
lowered. Mrs. Carter and the children got into the fourth or
fifth boat with Mrs. Astor, Mrs. Widener and Mrs. Thayer.</p>

<p>“After I got my family into the boat and saw it pushed off
the Titanic listed more and more to one side. I decided that I
had better look out for myself and went up to a deck on the starboard
side. In the meantime a good many boats were getting
off.</p>

<p>“There were no women on the starboard side when I reached
there except one collapsible raft load of third-class women
passengers. Mr. Ismay and myself got into the boat, which was
either the last or the next to the last to leave the Titanic.</p>

<p>“As we left the ship the lights went out and the Titanic<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_128">{128}</a></span>
started to go down. The crash had ripped up the side and the
water rushing into the boiler-room caused the boilers to explode.</p>

<p>“We were a good distance off when we saw the Titanic dip
and disappear. We stayed in the boat until about 5 o’clock, Mr.
Ismay and myself pulling on the oars with three members of the
crew practically all the time.</p>

<p>“Never in my life have I seen such splendid discipline as was
maintained by Captain Smith and his men. There was no panic
and the order was splendid.</p>

<p>“Before I left Harry Widener I urged him to come with me
to the starboard side of the ship, and it was then he told me he
would take his chances on the vessel. He had on a life belt, as
did every other passenger, many of whom stayed in the smoking
room playing bridge.</p>

<h3>MR. WIDENER PARTED FROM HIS WIFE.</h3>

<p>“I saw Colonel Astor place his wife in the same boat that I
put my family in, and at the same time Mr. Widener parted from
his wife and Mr. Thayer put Mrs. Thayer in the boat. I did not
see the men again.”</p>

<p>Major Arthur Puechen, a wealthy resident of Toronto,
Canada, was the last man on the Titanic to say good-bye to
Charles M. Hays, president of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway,
who lost his life.</p>

<p>After assisting members of the crew in filling up the first
five boats, Major Puechen who is an experienced yachtsman, was
assigned by the second mate to take charge of boat No. 6. Major
Puechen said he declined to accept such a post, not desiring to
have any preference over any of his fellow passengers.</p>

<p>Captain Smith, wishing an experienced boatsman on boat
No. 6, directed the second officer to give the Major a written order
to take charge of it. Major Puechen displayed this order
to some of his friends last night, so as to make it plain that it was
at the demand of the ship’s officers that he undertook the assignment.</p>

<p>Just as the Major was about to leave in the lifeboat, his old<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_129">{129}</a></span>
friend, Charles M. Hays, of the Grand Trunk, came up and said
good-bye. Mr. Hays had no idea, according to Major Puechen
that the ship would sink as soon as it did, but believed that help
would be at hand sufficient to care for all before the vessel went
down.</p>

<p>Mr. Hays remarked to the Major that the ship could not
possibly sink within eight hours, and that long before then every
body would be taken off safely. Mr. Hays expressed no fear
that he would be lost by remaining on board the ship.</p>

<p>Peter D. Daly, of New York, jumped from the deck of the
Titanic after it was announced that there were only boats enough
for the women and children. As he saw the ship settling gradually
he swam away with all his might to prevent being carried
down with the suction of the sinking liner.</p>

<h3>PICKED UP BY CARPATHIA.</h3>

<p>“For six hours I beat the water with hands and feet to keep
warm,” he said. “Then I was picked up by one of the Carpathia’s
boats, which was cruising around looking for survivors.
I was numb from the cold, after a fight which I can scarcely
bear to discuss.</p>

<p>“Even after I recovered from the chill and shock, I was practically
prostrated by the nervous strain, and every mention of the
disaster sends a shiver through me.</p>

<p>“There was no violent impact when the vessel collided
with the ice. I rushed to the deck from my cabin, got a life preserver
and, when things began to look serious, threw myself into
the water. The boat had already begun to settle.”</p>

<p>A huge cake of ice was the means of aiding Emile Portaluppi,
of Aricgabo, Italy, in escaping death when the Titanic
went down. Portaluppi, a second class passenger, was awakened
by the explosion of one of the boilers of the ship. He hurried
to the deck, strapped a life preserver around him and leaped into
the sea. With the aid of the preserver and by holding to a cake
of ice he managed to keep afloat until one of the lifeboats pick<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_130">{130}</a></span>ed
him up. There were thirty-five people in the boat when he
was hauled aboard.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lucine P. Smith, of Huntington, W. Va., daughter of
Representative James P. Hughes, of West Virginia, a bride of
about eight weeks, whose husband was lost in the wreck, gave
her experience through the medium of her uncle, Dr. J. H. Vincent,
of Huntington, West Virginia.</p>

<p>“The women were shoved into the lifeboats,” said Dr. Vincent.
“The crew did not wait until the lifeboat was filled before
they lowered it. As a matter of fact there were but twenty-six
people in the boat, mostly all women, when an officer gave
instructions to lower it. Mr. Smith was standing alongside the
boat when it was lowered. There was plenty of room for more
people to get into the lifeboats, the capacity being fifty.</p>

<h3>APPEALS TO CAPTAIN WERE IGNORED.</h3>

<p>“Mrs. Smith implored Captain Smith to allow her husband
in the boat, but her repeated appeals, however, were ignored.
This lifeboat was permitted to be lowered with but one sailor in
it and he was drunk. His condition was such that he could not
row the boat and therefore the women had to do the best they
could in rowing about the icy waters.</p>

<p>“As the boat swung out from the side it was evident that
the three men knew absolutely nothing about rowing and Mrs.
Kenyon said she and another woman seized the oars and helped
the sailors to pull clear. Gradually the small boat was worked
away from the Titanic. The boat had gone quite a distance
when suddenly all heard a terrific explosion and in the glare
which followed they saw the body of a man hurled from the
bridge high in the air. Then darkness fell. At 6.30 the boat was
picked up by the Carpathia.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Dyker, of Westhaven, Conn., a bride whose
husband perished, lost besides her husband all her worldly possessions.</p>

<p>“When the crash came,” said Mrs. Dyker, “I met Adolph on
deck. He had a satchel in which were two gold watches, two<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_131">{131}</a></span>
diamond rings, a sapphire necklace and two hundred crowns. He
couldn’t go in the boat with me but grabbed a life preserver and
said he would try to save himself. That was the last I saw of
him. When the lifeboat came alongside the Carpathia one of
the men in it threw my satchel to the deck. I have not seen it
since.”</p>

<p>Kate Mullin, of County Longford, Ireland, told of how stewards
had tried to keep back the steerage women. She said
she saw scores of men and women jump overboard and drown.</p>

<p>Bunar Tonglin, a Swede, was saved in the next to the last
boat which left the Titanic. Before getting into the boat he
placed two hysterical women in another boat. Then he heard a
cry, and, looking up, saw a woman standing on the upper deck.
The woman, he said, dropped from her arms her baby, which
Tonglin caught, and gave to one of the women he had put in the
boat. Then he got into his own boat, which was lowered, and
shortly afterwards came the two explosions, and the plunge
downward of the Titanic. Tonglin declared that he had seen
numerous persons leap from the decks of the Titanic and drown.</p>

<h3>HELPS HIS WIFE TO A PLACE IN THE BOAT.</h3>

<p>Mrs. Fred R. Kenyon, of Southington, Conn., was one of
the Titanic’s survivors. Her husband went down with the vessel
rather than take the place of a woman in a boat. Mrs. Kenyon
said that when the call was given for the women to take
places near the boat davits, in readiness to be placed in the boats
as they were swung off, Mr. Kenyon was by her side. When
it came her turn to enter the boat, Mr. Kenyon helped his wife to
a place and kissed her good-bye. Mrs. Kenyon said she asked
him to come with her, and he replied: “I would not with all
those women and children waiting to get off.”</p>

<p>In an instant Mr. Kenyon had stepped back and other women
took their places and the boat swung clear and dropped to
the water. In the boat Mrs. Kenyon said there were one sailor
and three men who had been ordered in because they said they
could row.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_132">{132}</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. John B. Thayer, whose husband, the second vice-president
of the Pennsylvania Railroad, went down with the Titanic,
after heroically standing aside to allow his wife’s maid to take his
place in the lifeboat, and whose young son, John B. Thayer, Jr.,
was pulled aboard a lifeboat after being thrown from the giant
liner just before she sank, seemed too dazed by what she had
gone through to realize the awful enormity of the tragedy when
she reached her home at Haverford, Pa.</p>

<p>After reaching the Thayer home Mrs. Thayer was put to
bed and the greatest precautions were taken to see that neither
she nor young “Jack” Thayer was disturbed. Detectives from
the Pennsylvania Railroad, assisted by two members of the Lower
Merion police force, guarded the house both front and rear.
All callers were told that both Mrs. Thayer and her son were too
much overcome by their heart-breaking experience to see any one.</p>

<h3>DIED TO SAVE WIFE’S MAID.</h3>

<p>Mrs. Thayer, young John B. Thayer, junior no longer, Miss
Eustis, a sister of Mrs. Walter B. Stephenson, of Haverford, and
Margaret Fleming, Mrs. Thayer’s maid, for whose safety Mr.
Thayer sacrificed his own life, all arrived at the Haverford Station
at 12.30 o’clock. They had made the trip from Jersey City
in a special train consisting of an engine, baggage car and Pullman,
with two day coaches to add the necessary weight to
make the train ride easily. The special left the Pennsylvania
Station at 10.16 and drew up at the Haverford Station just two
hours and fourteen minutes later.</p>

<p>Harry C. Thayer, of Merion, a brother of Mr. Thayer, met
his sister-in-law and nephew at the New York pier where the
Carpathia docked, together with Dr. R. G. Gamble, of Haverford,
the Thayers’ family physician. Mrs. Thayer, though seemingly
composed, is really in a very serious condition, according to Dr.
Gamble. Her hours of exposure in an open boat, her uncertainty
as to the fate of her son, whom she saw jump overboard, just
before the Titanic sank, carrying her husband to a watery grave,
was more than any woman could be expected to bear.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_133">{133}</a></span></p>

<p>Eight or ten friends and relatives of the Thayer family, together
with Captain Donaghy, of the Lower Merion police department,
and a squad of his men, were awaiting the special train
at the Haverford Station. A big limousine automobile was also
on hand with the motor running, ready to whisk the party to the
Thayer home, “Redwood,” just back of the Merion Cricket Club.</p>

<p>As the train slowed up, the relatives and friends formed a
double line opposite the Pullman car. The moment the train
stopped, Mrs. Thayer was helped down the steps and to the automobile.
Wearing heavy brown furs, a dark hat with a half veil,
Mrs. Thayer looked dazed and walked as one asleep, as she was
assisted into the motor car. Her son, young “Jack” Thayer, was
at her side, with Miss Eustis and the maid, Margaret Fleming,
bringing up the rear. The boy, a husky youngster, looked little
the worse for his experiences and bore himself in manly fashion.</p>

<h3>TOO OVERCOME TO BE QUESTIONED.</h3>

<p>There was a clang of the motor car door, a crashing bang
as the gears were shoved into place and the machine was off at
top speed for the Thayer residence. Dr. Gamble, whose car was
also in waiting, acted as spokesman for all. Mrs. Thayer, he
said, was too overcome to be questioned, but he had gleaned
from young “Jack” Thayer and from Margaret Fleming, the
maid, a few details that brought out in vivid relief the quiet heroism
of Mr. Thayer.</p>

<p>The son, also had proven, himself in the critical moment.
Shortly after the Titanic crashed into the iceberg, said the doctor,
Mr. Thayer had collected his wife, his son and his wife’s maid
and gotten them in line for a lifeboat. Realizing that there was
not enough room for the men, Mr. Thayer forced his wife and
her maid into the boat and then tried to get his son in also.</p>

<p>The lad, however, refused to desert his father. Stepping
back, he made room for some one else, said to have been a
grown man, and grasping his father’s hand, said he “guessed
he would stick by dad.” Before Mr. Thayer could protest or<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_134">{134}</a></span>
forcibly place his son in the lifeboat, it had been launched and
the opportunity was gone.</p>

<p>A few seconds before the Titanic sank, however, Mr. Thayer
seemed to grasp the fact that the end was near. Picking up
the boy he threw him into the sea. “Swim to a boat, my boy,” he
said.</p>

<p>Young Thayer, taken by surprise, had no chance to object.
Before he knew what had happened, he was struggling in the
icy waters of the ocean. Striking out, the lad swam to a lifeboat,
said Mr. Gamble, but was beaten off by some of those
aboard, as the boat was already overcrowded.</p>

<p>But the pluck that has made so many Thayers famous as
athletes in many branches of sport was deeply implanted in
young “Jack” Thayer. Turning from the lifeboat from which
he had been beaten off, he swam to another. Once again he
was fended away with a long oar. And all this time Mrs. Thayer,
safe in another boat, watched her son struggle for life, too
overcome with horror to even scream.</p>

<h3>NOT AS MUCH SUCTION AS EXPECTED.</h3>

<p>A few seconds later the Titanic went down. There was
a swirling of the waters, though not as much suction as had
been expected. To save himself from the tug of the indraw
waters, young Thayer grasped a floating cake of ice. To this
he clung until another boat, filled with people of more kindly
hearts, came by and pulled him aboard.</p>

<p>In this boat was Miss Brown, a friend of the boy’s mother.
She took charge of him until they were taken on board the
Carpathia. Mrs. Thayer had not seen the rescue of her son.
She had fainted, it is said, but revived a few moments later and
did yeoman service at the oars. Other survivors in her boat
spoke in the highest terms of her calm courage, which served to
keep up the spirits of the women, half frozen from
the bitter cold, insufficiently clad and bereft of their
loved ones. Taking an oar, without waiting to be asked, she
used every ounce of her strength for long hours before the Car<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_135">{135}</a></span>pathia
arrived, aiding the few sailors aboard to keep the boat’s
head to the sea and to dodge the myriads of ice cakes.</p>

<p>The exercise, however, served to keep her warm, and when
she was lifted to the deck of the Carpathia she did not need
hospital treatment. Her son, however, was in bad shape when
he was rescued. His clothing was frozen to his body and he was
exhausted from his battle with the ice-filled sea. Restoratives
and hot water bottles in the Carpathia’s hospital brought him
around in time, however, and the moment he was able to stand
on his feet he rushed through the ship, seeking his mother. That
was a joyful reunion for both, but particularly for Mrs. Thayer,
as she had given her son up for lost.</p>

<h3>STAYED ON BOARD UNTIL SHE SANK.</h3>

<p>Broken in spirits, bowed with grief, Mrs. Thayer stepped
off the Carpathia at New York with the other few hundreds
of survivors last night. With her was her young son, John B.
Thayer, Jr., who stayed on board the vessel until she sank to
share his father’s fate, but who proved more fortunate than the
railroad magnate, and was saved. She was heavily veiled and
was supported by the son, who seemed, with his experience, to
have aged twice his sixteen years.</p>

<p>Awaiting her arrival was a special train, sent by officers of
the Pennsylvania Railroad for her arrival. One of the cars
was that in which she and Mr. Thayer frequently had taken
trips together. It was in this car that she rode to Philadelphia,
the last time she ever will enter it.</p>

<p>Every arrangement had been made for the care and comfort
of Mrs. Thayer. Immediately upon her arrival at the pier where
the rescue ship, Carpathia, docked, relatives and representatives
of the railroad were ready to receive her.</p>

<p>A motor car had been held in readiness and when she disembarked
from the vessel, leaning upon the arm of her young
son, she was led silently to it. They were the first of the Philadelphia
survivors to arrive at the Pennsylvania station. It was
exactly 10 o’clock when the car in which she and her son had<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_136">{136}</a></span>
ridden, pulled up outside the great building erected when her
husband was one of the directing heads of the road. With her
was Dr. Neidermeier, the station physician, who had been sent
to take care of her during the short time she stayed in New
York. Tenderly he lifted Mrs. Thayer to the pavement and
then led her inside and across the central floor toward the train.</p>

<p>Garments had been brought from her home for Mrs. Thayer,
to take the place of those which she had worn when, scantily
clad, she bade her husband good-bye and climbed down
the ladder of the Titanic to the waiting lifeboats. But the widow
was too worn physically and too greatly bowed down with
grief to make the change. She wore a thin raincoat which
reached nearly to the ground. Its folds were wrinkled. A heavy
veil completely covered her head, crushing down her hat.</p>

<h3>MET AT THE CUNARD PIER.</h3>

<p>Following her from the cab came her son and Henry Thayer,
a brother of the former railroad man. Dr. Gamble, the family
physician, and Mr. Norris, a relative of Mrs. Thayer, were
also in the party which had met her at the Cunard pier.</p>

<p>As the widow of their former chief passed them, the employes
of the railroad stopped and removed their hats. T. DeWitt
Cuyler, a director of the Pennsylvania Railroad, saw her
coming and stepped toward her. As he did so, Dr. Neidermeier
quickly grasped his arm and drew him to one side where Mrs.
Thayer would not hear.</p>

<p>“Mr. Thayer is dead,” the physician whispered silently.
Mr. Cuyler gripped the doctor’s hand and then, his face working
violently, he turned quickly away.</p>

<p>It was only a few minutes after Mrs. Thayer had stepped on
board the car that the train started for Philadelphia. It left the
station at 10.19 o’clock.</p>

<p>“I was with father,” said “Jack” Thayer, speaking for himself
of his experience. “They wanted me to go into a boat, but
I wanted to stay with him. Men and women kept calling to me
to hurry and jump in a boat, but it wasn’t any use. I knew what<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_137">{137}</a></span>
I was doing. It didn’t seem to be anything to be afraid about.
Some of the men were laughing. Nobody appeared to be excited.
We had struck with a smash and then we seemed to slide off
backwards from the big field of ice. It was cold, but we didn’t
mind that.</p>

<p>“The boats were put off without much fuss. Mother was
put into one of the boats. As I said, she wanted me to go with
her. But I said I guessed I would stick with dad. After awhile
I felt the ship tipping toward the front. The next thing I knew
somebody gave me a push and I was in the water. Down, down,
down, I went, ever so far. It seemed as if I never would stop. I
couldn’t breathe. Then I shot up through the water just as fast
as I went down. I had just time to take a long, deep breath when
a wave went over me.</p>

<p>“When I came to the surface a second time I swam to a boat.
They wouldn’t take me in. Then I tried another. Same result.
Finally, when I was growing weak, I bumped against something.
I found it was an overturned lifeboat. It was a struggle to pull
myself upon it, but I did it after a while. My, it was cold! I
never suffered so much in my life. All around were the icebergs.</p>

<p>“I could see boats on all sides. I must have shouted, because
my throat was all raw and sore, but nobody seemed to
notice. I guess they all were shouting, too. Every part of me
ached with the cold. I thought I was going to die. It seemed
as if I couldn’t stand it any longer.</p>

<p>“The time was so long and I was so weak. Then I just
couldn’t feel anything any more. I knew if I stayed there I
would freeze. A boat came by and I swam to it. They took me
aboard. The next thing I remember clearly was when the boat
from the Carpathia came and I was taken into it and wrapped
up in the coats of the men. They told me I was more than three
hours on that raft and in that open boat. It seemed more like
three years to me.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_138">{138}</a></span>”</p>

MAJOR BUTT, MARTYR TO DUTY.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">Major Butt Martyr to Duty&mdash;Woman’s Soul-Stirring Tribute&mdash;Died
Like a Soldier&mdash;Was the Man of the Hour&mdash;Assisted
Captain and Officers in Saving Women&mdash;Cool as if on Dress
Parade&mdash;Robert M. Daniel Tells of Disaster and Death of
Heroes&mdash;Tiny Waifs of the Sea.</p></div>

<p>Captain E. J. Smith, the commander of the Titanic, was a
guest at a banquet which was being given by W. Bruce Ismay,
managing director of the White Star Line, when the big steamer
plunged into that fated iceberg, according to Robert M. Daniel,
member of the banking firm of Hillard-Smith, Daniel &amp; Co., 328
Chestnut street, Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The fourth officer was in charge of the vessel, said Mr.
Daniel, when seen at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York, to which
hotel he went immediately after landing from the Carpathia,
accompanied by his mother and younger brother, who had come
up from their home in Virginia to meet him.</p>

<p>“We were about fifty miles ahead of our schedule at the time
the accident happened,” said Mr. Daniel, “and were running at
about a twenty-mile-an-hour rate. Everybody on board had
been talking all along about how we were trying to beat the
Olympic’s record for the Western trip and many pools were
made on each day’s run.</p>

<p>“I was asleep in my berth when the collision came and so
cannot tell how we happened to hit that berg or what occurred
immediately afterwards. I got up and looked out of my stateroom
door, but all seemed to be quiet and I went back to bed
again.</p>

<p>“A little later I heard some one crying that the boats were
being manned and I got frightened. So I wrapped an overcoat<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_139">{139}</a></span>
about me and went on deck. On the way I grabbed a life belt
and tied it on.</p>

<p>“The boat had already sunk so far down that the lower
decks were awash. I didn’t waste any time in thinking. I just
jumped overboard. I clung to the same overturned lifeboat that
young John B. Thayer, Jr., swam to later and saw him jump
from the Titanic. It looked to me as though his father pushed
him off and jumped after him, but the boat sank so soon afterwards
and things were so mixed up that I couldn’t be sure about
that.</p>

<p>“A boat came by after a while that was full of women.
They were frightened and seeing me, pulled me aboard, saying
they needed a man to take charge. I did my best to cheer them
up, but it was a poor effort and didn’t succeed very well. Still I
kept them busy with one thing and another and so helped pass
the weary hours until we were picked up by the Carpathia.”</p>

<h3>JUMPED AS THE LINER WAS GOING DOWN.</h3>

<p>Mr. Daniel stated with emphasis that Colonel John Jacob
Astor stayed on the Titanic until the last second, then jumped
just as the liner was going down, and he did not see the millionaire
again.</p>

<p>Captain Smith also stuck to the bridge, until the ship sank,
said Mr. Daniel, when the skipper also jumped, but disappeared
below the waves and apparently never came up again.</p>

<p>“I spoke to the fourth officer just before I went to my cabin,”
said Mr. Daniel, “and he told me he was in charge while the captain
was at dinner. Then I remembered I had heard Ismay was
giving a banquet.</p>

<p>“The fourth officer said the skipper was coming up ‘pretty
soon’ to relieve him,” added Mr. Daniel.</p>

<p>On the Carpathia, Mr. Daniel said, were nineteen women
who had been made widows by the Titanic disaster. Six of
them were young brides who were returning on the steamship
from honeymoon trips on the Continent. None of them, he said,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_140">{140}</a></span>
was able to obtain from the passengers of the Carpathia mourning
garb.</p>

<p>While on the Carpathia Mr. Daniel proved of considerable
assistance to the wireless operator. He is an amateur student of
wireless telegraphy. Following the disaster the operator on the
Carpathia was compelled to work night and day.</p>

<p>While the operator was engaged in the arduous task of
sending to shore the long list of those who had been snatched
from the sea, Mr. Daniel went into the operating room. He
found the operator on the verge of collapse, and, volunteering
his services, sent a large part of the list himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel denied that all the lifeboats and collapsible rafts
launched from the Titanic had been picked up by the Carpathia.</p>

<p>“Only twelve boats were picked up,” he said, “while there
were half a dozen more that drifted away in other directions.
There has been no storm, and I don’t see why they should not
have been located by some other vessel.”</p>

<h3>“FRANKFURT” MUCH NEARER THAN CARPATHIA.</h3>

<p>A German steamer, the “Frankfurt,” was thirty-five miles
nearer to the Titanic than was the Carpathia at the time of the
accident, but for some reason would not come to the assistance
of the stricken liner, Mr. Daniel said.</p>

<p>Asked if any women had been left aboard the Titanic he
said: “Only those women who positively refused to leave their
husbands and who could not be forced into lifeboats for lack
of time.</p>

<p>“One of the most remarkable features of this horrible affair
is the length of time that elapsed after the collision before the
seriousness of the situation dawned on the passengers. The
officers assured everybody that there was no danger, and we all
had such confidence in the Titanic that it didn’t occur to anybody
that she might sink.”</p>

<p>As to the reports that many persons had been shot to prevent
them from rushing the lifeboats, Mr. Daniel said several
shots had been fired in the air to frighten the steerage passengers<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_141">{141}</a></span>
and keep them in order, but that he did not know or hear of anyone
being hit by a bullet.</p>

<p>Mrs. John Jacob Astor, said Mr. Daniel, had been confined
to her stateroom under the doctor’s care during her stay on the
Carpathia. “I did not lay eyes on her nor on Bruce Ismay. He
stuck close to his cabin and I don’t think he came on deck once
during the trip on the Carpathia.”</p>

<p>Even when the passengers finally realized that the Titanic
was doomed, there was no disorder, according to Mr. Daniel.
The crew’s discipline was perfect and the women were placed
in the boats quietly and without confusion. It was only after
the ship had gone down, he added, and the women awoke to the
fact that their husbands, brothers, sons and sweethearts, who
had told them they would follow “in other boats,” had sunk to
their death, that there was any hysteria.</p>

<h3>THE CRIES WERE HEART-RENDING.</h3>

<p>“Then the cries were awful to listen to; some of the women
screamed all the time. For four straight hours they kept at it.
First from one boat, then from another. It was heart-rending.”</p>

<p>Asked why the Carpathia had refused to answer the wireless
messages relayed to her, Mr. Daniel answered that so many
land stations were trying to get the vessel that the air was full
of cross currents, and it was almost impossible to catch any one
message meant for the rescue ship, let alone trying to reply to
any of them.</p>

<p>While Mr. Daniel was talking to the newspaper men on the
pier, just after landing from the Carpathia, a man ran up and,
showing him two newspaper photographs, asked if he remembered
the face.</p>

<p>“It’s my brother, Mr. White, of California,” said the man.
“Is he on board the Carpathia?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” answered Mr. Daniel. “I remember
meeting this gentleman on board the Titanic, but I have not seen
him since.” Mr. White’s brother grabbed the photographs and
rushed away.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_142">{142}</a></span></p>

<p>Many of the men, said Mr. Daniel, refused to jump from the
Titanic until the ship was actually disappearing beneath the
waves.</p>

<p>“They seemed to think they were safer on board,” he said,
“and by waiting too long lost their chance of being saved, for
they were probably carried down by the suction. Howard B.
Case, of New York, was one who declined to jump. C. Duane
Williams was another. He was washed overboard, but his son,
Richard Norris Williams, jumped and was saved.”</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel was in the water or on a cake of ice nearly an
hour before he was pulled aboard a lifeboat. He had nothing to
keep him from freezing save a light overcoat over his pajamas.
While on the Carpathia he slept on the floor of the dining saloon
and was so weak when he landed that he could hardly move.</p>

<p>When in Philadelphia, Mr. Daniel makes his home at the
Southern Club, though he is a native of Richmond, Va., where
his mother and brother live.</p>

<h3>CRAWLED ON TO CAKE OF ICE.</h3>

<p>“When I finally went on deck,” said Mr. Daniel, “the water
already was up to my ankles. I saw the women and some of the
men taking to the boats. A short distance away was a big cake
of ice. I jumped for it and crawled on it.</p>

<p>“John B. Thayer, Jr., came to the same ice cake later, after
the Titanic sank. Then a boat passed near and he swam to it
and was pulled aboard. A half hour afterwards another boat
came by and I was pulled aboard.</p>

<p>“It seemed a long time before we saw the masts of the Carpathia,
but when the straight masts and the blur of smoke from
her funnels were outlined against the horizon, we realized that
it meant rescue for all of us. When the boat finally reached us,
the men in the boat did what they could to help the women to
the vessel, but most of us were almost helpless from the cold and
exposure.</p>

<p>“I cannot pretend to explain the accident. All I can say is
that we knew for five hours before the accident that there were<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_143">{143}</a></span>
ice fields about. I saw Colonel Astor after I was on the raft.
He was still on deck. The water was washing about his knees.
He made no effort to get into a boat.</p>

<p>“The last I saw of Major Butt,” Mr. Daniel added, “he was
playing bridge whist with Clarence Moore, of Washington, formerly
of Philadelphia, and widely known as a horse show exhibitor,
and two other men. This was just before I went to my
cabin.</p>

<p>“When I came on deck again, I did not see him. I have no
doubt he met his death as a soldier should.”</p>

<p>Major Archibald Butt, U. S. A., military aid to President
Taft, who lost his life on the Titanic, met his death in a manner
that fully justified the President’s estimation of him as expressed
in the eulogy given out at the White House, in which the President
tenderly referred to his late aide as a man “gentle and considerate,”
and as one who was “every inch a soldier.”</p>

<h3>GRAVITY OF THE TITANIC’S CONDITION.</h3>

<p>From the moment the Titanic climbed to her death on the
jagged shelf of the great iceberg until the last boatload of women
and children, and some men, was lowered, Major Butt was to
all intents and purposes an officer not only of the American
Army, but of the British mercantile marine. He was among the
first to realize the gravity of the Titanic’s condition, and he immediately
forgot self and went to the assistance of the sorely
taxed skipper and junior officers of the sinking liner.</p>

<p>From the moment that Captain Smith let it be known to
his officers and a few of the men passengers that the Titanic was
doomed, Major Butt was an officer of the Titanic. He was here
and there and everywhere, giving words of encouragement to
weeping women and children, and uttering when necessary commands
to keep the weak-kneed men from giving in and rendering
the awful situation even more terrible.</p>

<p>That this was the manner in which Major Butt met death is
certain.</p>

<p>Captain Charles E. Crain, of the Twenty-seventh United<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_144">{144}</a></span>
States Infantry was a passenger on the Carpathia, and when he
learned that Major Butt was among the dead, he made it his
duty to get the true tale of his comrade’s death.</p>

<p>“Naturally,” said Captain Crain, “I was deeply concerned in
the fate of Major Butt, for he was not only a fellow-officer of the
army, but also a personal friend of many years’ standing. I
questioned those of the survivors who were in a condition to talk,
and from them I learned that Butt, when the Titanic struck, took
his position with the officers and from the moment that the order
to man the lifeboats was given until the last one was dropped
into the sea, he aided in the maintenance of discipline and the
placing of the women and children in the boats.</p>

<h3>AS COOL AS THE ICEBERG.</h3>

<p>“Butt, I was told was as cool as the iceberg that had
doomed the ship, and not once did he lose control of himself.
In the presence of death he was the same gallant, courteous officer
that the American people had learned to know so well as
a result of his constant attendance upon President Taft. There
was never any chance of Butt getting into any of those lifeboats.</p>

<p>“He knew his time was at hand, and he was ready to meet
it as a man should, and I and all of the others who cherish his
memory are glad that he faced the situation that way, which
was the only possible way a man of his calibre could face it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Henry B. Harris, of Washington, a survivor of the
Titanic, said:</p>

<p>“I saw Major Butt just before they put me into a collapsible
raft with ever so many women from the steerage. Mr Millet’s
little smile, which played on his lips all through the voyage,
had gone, but when I was put in the boat I saw him wave his
hand to a woman in another boat.</p>

<p>“But, oh, this whole world should rise in praise of Major
Butt. That man’s conduct will remain in my memory forever;
the way he showed some of the other men how to behave when
women and children were suffering that awful mental fear that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_145">{145}</a></span>
came when we had to be huddled in those boats. Major Butt
was near me, and I know very nearly everything he did.</p>

<p>“When the order to take to the boats came he became as
one in supreme command. You would have thought he was at
a White House Reception, so cool and calm was he. A dozen
or so women became hysterical all at once as something connected
with a lifeboat went wrong. Major Butt stepped to
them and said: ‘Really you must not act like that; we are all
going to see you through this thing.’</p>

<p>“He helped the sailors rearrange the rope or chain that had
gone wrong and lifted some of the women in with gallantry.
His was the manner we associate with the word aristocrat.</p>

<h3>MAJOR BUTT A MAN TO BE FEARED.</h3>

<p>“When the time came for it, he was a man to be feared.
In one of the earlier boats fifty women, it seemed, were about
to be lowered when a man, suddenly panic-stricken, ran to the
stern of it. Major Butt shot one arm out, caught him by the
neck and pulled him backward like a pillow. His head cracked
against a rail and he was stunned.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Sorry,’ said Major Butt; ‘women will be attended to first
or I’ll break every bone in your body.’</p>

<p>“The boats were lowered away, one by one, and as I stood
by my husband he said to me: ‘Thank God for Archie Butt.’
Perhaps Major Butt heard it, for he turned his face toward us
for a second.</p>

<p>“Just at that time a young man was arguing to get into a
lifeboat, and Butt had hold of the lad by the arm like a big brother
and appeared to be telling him to keep his head.</p>

<p>“I was one of three first cabin women in our collapsible boat,
the rest were steerage people. Major Butt helped those poor
frightened people so wonderfully, tenderly, and yet with such
cool and manly firmness. He was a soldier to the last.”</p>

<p>“If anything should happen to me, tell my wife in New
York that I’ve done my best in doing my duty.”</p>

<p>This was the last message of Benjamin Guggenheim, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_146">{146}</a></span>
the famous banking family, dictated to a steward only a short
while before the banker sank to his death with the Titanic.</p>

<p>It was not until several days later that the message
was received by Mrs. Guggenheim.</p>

<p>It was delivered by James Etches, assistant steward in the
first cabin of the Titanic, to whom Mr. Guggenheim communicated
it. Etches appeared at the St. Regis Hotel and inquired
for Mrs. Benjamin Guggenheim. He said that he had a message
from Benjamin Guggenheim, and that it had to be delivered in
person.</p>

<p>Mrs. Guggenheim was in the care of Daniel Guggenheim,
whose apartments are at the St. Regis. The steward was admitted,
but was not permitted to see Mrs. Guggenheim, who
is prostrated with grief. He insisted that he must see her personally,
but finally consented to transmit the message through
her brother-in-law.</p>

<h3>TOGETHER ALMOST TO THE END.</h3>

<p>“We were together almost to the end,” said the steward.
“I was saved. He went down with the ship. But that isn’t
what I want to tell Mrs. Guggenheim.”</p>

<p>Then the steward produced a piece of paper. He had written
the message on it, he said, to be certain that it would be
correct. The message was as given.</p>

<p>“That’s all he said,” added the steward, “there wasn’t time
for more.”</p>

<p>Little by little Mr. Guggenheim got the account of his
brother’s death from the steward. It was the first definite news
that he had received of his brother.</p>

<p>“Mr. Guggenheim was one of my charges,” said the steward
anew. “He had his secretary with him. His name was
Giglio, I believe, an Armenian, about twenty-four years old.
Both died like men.</p>

<p>“When the crash came I awakened them and told them
to get dressed. A few minutes later I went into their rooms<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_147">{147}</a></span>
and helped them to get ready. I put a life preserver on Mr.
Guggenheim. He said it hurt him in the back. There was
plenty of time and I took it off, adjusted it, and then put it on
him again. It was all right this time.</p>

<p>“They wanted to get out on deck with only a few clothes
on, but I pulled a heavy sweater over Mr. Guggenheim’s life
belt, and then they both went out. They stayed together and
I could see what they were doing. They were going from one
lifeboat to another helping the women and children.</p>

<p>“Mr. Guggenheim would shout out, ‘Women first,’ and he
was of great assistance to the officers.</p>

<p>“Things weren’t so bad at first, but when I saw Mr. Guggenheim
about three quarters of an hour after the crash there
was great excitement. What surprised me was that both Mr.
Guggenheim and his secretary were dressed in their evening
clothes. They had deliberately taken off their sweaters, and as
nearly as I can remember they wore no life belts at all.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>What’s that for?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>We’ve dressed up in our best,’ replied Mr. Guggenheim,
‘and are prepared to go down like gentlemen.’ It was then
he told me about the message to his wife and that is what I
have come here for.</p>

<p>“Well, shortly after the last few boats were lowered and
I was ordered by the deck officer to man an oar, I waved good-bye
to Mr. Guggenheim, and that was the last I saw of him
and his secretary.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_148">{148}</a></span>”</p>

MRS. ASTOR’S BRAVERY.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">Showed Wonderful Fortitude in the Hour of Peril&mdash;Sailors in
Lifeboat Tell Of Her Heroism&mdash;Pleaded To Remain With
Husband&mdash;Change Clothes to Embark&mdash;Seamen Confirm
Murdock’s Suicide&mdash;One Heartless Fiend&mdash;Williams
Killed as Funnel Fell.</p></div>

<p>Narratives of the remarkable heroism of Colonel John Jacob
Astor and the patient fortitude of Mrs. Astor under
conditions that tried the self-control of the hardiest, continue
to come to light.</p>

<p>The narrative of the dreadful suspense which in a short
time changed her from a radiant bride to a sorrowing widow
was told by a friend of the family.</p>

<p>At the same time survivors who occupied lifeboat No. 4,
in which Mrs. Astor and her maid escaped, told of how Mrs.
Astor had helped calm the other women and had even offered
fellow sufferers portions of her slender stock of clothing.</p>

<p>“Mrs Astor was the bravest little woman I ever met,” said
Jack Foley, who, with his mate, Sam Parks, pulled an oar in
boat No. 4.</p>

<p>“Colonel Astor was a man all through, if there ever was
one,” continued Foley. “You see, it took us some time to launch
boat No. 4. After we had all the women and the children in the
boat we discovered that we couldn’t launch her until we removed
the sounding spar several decks below.</p>

<p>“So Sam and I got down and chopped the spar away. We
were some time doing this, as we had to hunt for an ax.</p>

<p>“We finally got the spar away and launched the boat.
That is why boat No. 4 was the last boat to be launched. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_149">{149}</a></span>
others had a free way below it and could be put in the water at
once.</p>

<p>“While waiting up there Mrs. Astor several times wanted
to leave the boat. Mr. Astor kept telling the good little woman
that he was sure to be saved and that it was her duty to go.</p>

<p>“She stretched out her arms just as though she was pleading
with him to let her get out of the boat and take her place
with him. Mr. Astor picked up a heavy steamer shawl and
wrapped it about her shoulders.</p>

<p>“After pulling those eight men into the boat I was pretty
wet and was shivering. Mrs. Astor threw the shawl about my
shoulders and said that I needed it more than she did. I told
her that I would get warmed up after pulling a while at the oar
and would have no use for it.</p>

<h3>WHIMPERING WITH COLD.</h3>

<p>“I put the shawl back on her lap. Sitting next to Mrs. Astor
was a Swedish woman with a little girl that I should take to be
three or four years old. The little girl was whimpering with the
cold.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Astor took the shawl and threw it about the shoulders
of this woman, who thanked her in some foreign lingo. Then the
steerage woman kissed her little girl and took her into her arms
and wrapped the shawl about her.</p>

<p>“When the explosion occurred aboard the ship Mrs. Astor
made some kind of a sound, but I couldn’t understand whether
she said anything or merely sobbed. She turned her head away
from the direction of the vessel.”</p>

<p>So little was the impact felt at the time of the collision that
Mrs. Astor thought the crash was the result of some mishap in
the kitchen and paid no attention to it until the engines stopped.</p>

<p>Then, realizing that something was wrong, she inquired of
her steward the cause. He informed her that a slight accident
had happened, and that the captain had ordered the women to
the lifeboats, but he added that this was only a precautionary
measure, and that they would all be back soon again on the ship.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_150">{150}</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Astor then entered her stateroom and changed her
dress, preparatory to leaving the Titanic for one of the lifeboats
in company with her maid.</p>

<p>As she left the room the steward told her he would lock up
her suite so that nobody would enter it during her absence, for
he thought everybody would soon return.</p>

<p>Colonel Astor accompanied his wife and her maid to lifeboat
No. 4. When he attempted to enter it he was pushed back
by the sailor in charge, and was told that no men were permitted
in it.</p>

<p>“But,” said Colonel Astor, “there are no more women to be
taken in, and there is plenty of room.”</p>

<p>“That makes no difference,” replied the man; “the orders
are no men, so you cannot get in.”</p>

<p>There was no use arguing, Colonel and Mrs. Astor thought,
so, waving her adieu, he called out:</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Madeleine.”</p>

<h3>TITANIC GOING DOWN TO HER DOOM.</h3>

<p>Lifeboat No. 4 did not go far before she returned to the
place which soon after became the Titanic’s grave. The great
“unsinkable” ship was already going fast to her doom, and fear
that the suction from the sinking vessel would draw down the
little lifeboat made its sailors once more turn away from the
wreck and seek safety, with its handful of women and its empty
seats.</p>

<p>When the Carpathia hove in sight two sailors in lifeboat No.
4 were dead. The watch of one, which a woman looked at, had
stopped at 2.15 o’clock.</p>

<p>In the roster of the Titanic’s heroes the name of Robbins
should appear. He was Colonel Astor’s old butler, and, like the
Colonel’s valet, always traveled with him. He is numbered
among the Titanic’s dead.</p>

<p>Faithful unto death was Kitty, Colonel Astor’s Airedale
terrier and constant companion. On land or sea, Kitty was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_151">{151}</a></span>
never far from her master’s heels, and the two were familiar
figures on 5th avenue.</p>

<p>When the crash came Robbins went below and brought
Kitty up on deck. There, the most faithful of friends, she stood
beside her master while the sea embraced them, and she now
shares his grave.</p>

<p>Reports that a number of men&mdash;probably steerage passengers&mdash;on
the Titanic who tried to rush the lifeboats and preempt
the places of women and children were unceremoniously
shot were confirmed by Jack Williams and William French, able
seamen, survivors of the Titanic’s crew.</p>

<h3>THE FIRST STAMPEDE.</h3>

<p>“When the first of the 56-foot lifeboats were being filled,”
explained Williams, “the first stampede of panic-stricken men
occurred. Within a dozen feet of where I stood I saw fully
ten men throw themselves into the boats already crowded with
women and children.</p>

<p>“These men were dragged back and hurled sprawling across
the deck. Six of them, screaming with fear, struggled to their
feet and made a second attempt to rush the boats.</p>

<p>“About ten shots sounded in quick succession. The six
cowardly men were stopped in their tracks, staggered and collapsed
one after another. At least two of them vainly attempted to
creep toward the boats again. The others lay quite still. This
scene of bloodshed served its purpose. In that particular section
of the deck there was no further attempt to violate the ‘women
and children first’ rule.”</p>

<p>“Were any of these men from the first or second cabins?”
Williams was asked.</p>

<p>Williams, a medium-sized, stockily-built, blond-haired man
of thirty-six passed the query on to his sailor chum French,
who replied:</p>

<p>“It was hard to tell. All of them were so scantily dressed.
In the semi-darkness and prevailing excitement faces left no dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_152">{152}</a></span>tinct
impression with me. I should say that most, if not all of
them, were from the steerage.</p>

<p>“Other men passengers who in a general way resembled
these same men were among a score or so who jumped from the
upper decks into the boats occupied by women and children,
after the order had been given to lower boats. These men were
not shot. They were tossed by the officers and crew of the boat
into the sea, where most of them perished, as they deserved to.</p>

<p>“The report that First Officer Murdock and not Captain
Smith, shot himself on the bridge just as the forward section
of the Titanic sank is true. I still have before me the picture
of Mr. Murdock standing on the bridge as the waters surged
up about him, placing the pistol to his head and disappearing
as the shot that ended his life rang out.”</p>

<h3>EMERGENCY BOATS MADE READY.</h3>

<p>“French and I,” said Williams, “stood by as the two emergency
boats&mdash;those that are always kept ready for rescue purposes
at sea&mdash;were made ready. These boats were only twenty-six
feet long, while the regular lifeboats are about fifty-six feet
in length.</p>

<p>“It was in the first of these emergency boats that Mr. Ismay
put off. This boat and emergency boat No. 2 were launched
with first class passengers less than a half hour after the collision.</p>

<p>“A lot had been printed in the papers about the heroism of
the officers, but little has been said of the bravery of the men below
the decks. I was told that seventeen enginemen who were
drowned side by side got down on their knees on the platform
of the engine room and prayed until the water surged up to their
necks.</p>

<p>“Then they stood up clasped hands so as to form a circle
and died together. All of these men helped rake the fires out
from ten of the forward boilers after the crash. This delayed the
explosion and undoubtedly permitted the ship to remain afloat
nearly an hour longer, and thus saved hundreds of lives.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_153">{153}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Mrs. John C. Hogeboom, her sister, Miss Cornelia T. Andrews,
and their niece, Miss Gretchen F. Longley, of Hudson,
N. Y., were at the home of Mrs Arthur E. Flack, in East
Orange, N. J., where Miss Andrews told how she and her aunts
waited for the fourth lifeboat because there was not room for the
three of them in the first three boats launched.</p>

<p>“And when we finally did get into a boat,” continued Miss
Andrews, “we found that our miserable men companions could
not row and had only said they could because they wanted to
save themselves. Finally I had to take an oar with one of the
able seamen in the boat.</p>

<p>“Alongside of us was a sailor, who lighted a cigarette and
flung the match carelessly among us women. Several women in
the boat screamed, fearing they would be set on fire. The sailor
replied: ‘We are going to hell anyway and we might as well
be cremated now as then.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>At this point Mrs. Hogeboom interrupted and said:</p>

<h3>BETTER PUT ON LIFE PRESERVERS.</h3>

<p>“A little after 12 we heard commotion in the corridor and
we made more inquiries, and they told us we had better put on
life preservers. We had only five minutes to get ready. We
put our fur coats right on over our night dresses and rushed on
deck.</p>

<p>“One lifeboat was already full, but there was no panic. The
discipline in a way was good. No one hurried and no one crowded.
We waited for the fourth boat and were slowly lowered
seventy-five feet to the water. The men made no effort to get
into the boat. As we pulled away we saw them all standing in
an unbroken line on the deck.</p>

<p>“There they stood&mdash;Major Butt, Colonel Astor waving a
farewell to his wife; Mr. Thayer, Mr. Case, Mr. Clarence Moore,
Mr. Widener, all multi-millionaires, and hundreds of other men
bravely smiling at us all. Never have I seen such chivalry and
fortitude. Such courage in the face of fate horrible to contemplate
filled us even then with wonder and admiration.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_154">{154}</a></span></p>

<p>“Before our boat was lowered they called to some miserable
specimens of humanity and said: ‘Can you row?’ and for the
purpose of getting in they answered ‘Yes.’ But upon pulling
out we found we had a Chinese and an American, neither of
whom knew how to row. So there we were in mid-ocean with
one able-bodied seaman.</p>

<p>“Then my niece took one oar and assisted the seaman and
some of the other women rowed on the other side. We then
pulled out about a mile as we feared the suction should the ship
go down.</p>

<p>“Scarcely any of the lifeboats were properly manned. Two,
filled with women and children, capsized before our eyes. The
collapsible boats were only temporarily useful. They soon partially
filled with water. In one boat eighteen or twenty persons
sat in water above their knees for six hours.</p>

<h3>EIGHT MEN THROWN OVERBOARD.</h3>

<p>“Eight men in this boat were overcome, died and were
thrown overboard. Two women were in this boat. One succumbed
after a few hours and one was saved.</p>

<p>“The accident was entirely the result of carelessness and
lack of necessary equipment. There were boats for only one-third
of the passengers&mdash;there were no searchlights&mdash;the lifeboats
were not supplied with food or safety appliances&mdash;there
were no lanterns on the lifeboats&mdash;there was no way to raise
sails, as we had no one who understood managing a sailboat.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hogeboom explained that the new equipment of masts
and sails in the boats was carefully wrapped and bound with
twine. The men undertook to unfasten them, but found it necessary
to cut the ropes. They had no knives, and in their frenzy
they went about asking the ill-clad women if they had knives.
The sails were never hoisted.</p>

<p>According to Richard Norris Williams, Jr., his father, C.
Duane Williams, was killed, not drowned, in the Titanic wreck.</p>

<p>The son, who, with his father, was on his way to visit Rich<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_155">{155}</a></span>ard
Norris Williams, his uncle, 8124 St. Martin’s lane, Chestnut
Hill, Pa., says his father was crushed to death by a falling funnel.</p>

<p>His account of the tragedy was given through Mrs. Alexander
Williams, daughter-in-law of Richard Norris Williams.</p>

<p>“Richard told us,” she said, “that he and his father had been
watching the Titanic’s lifeboats lowered and filled with women.
The water was up to their waists and the ship was about at her
last.</p>

<p>“Suddenly one of the great funnels fell. Richard sprang
aside, trying to drag his father after him. But Mr. Williams was
caught under the funnel. A moment later the funnel was swept
overboard, and the decks were cleared of water. Mr. Williams,
the father, had disappeared.</p>

<h3>SWAM THROUGH THE ICE.</h3>

<p>“Richard sprang overboard and swam through the ice to
a life raft. He was pulled aboard. There were five other men
there and one woman. Occasionally they were swept off into
the sea, even the woman, but they always managed to climb back.
Finally those on the raft were picked up by a Titanic lifeboat,
and later were saved by the Carpathia.”</p>

<p>Young Mr. Williams said he didn’t see J. Bruce Ismay, managing
director of the White Star Line, after the iceberg was
struck. He didn’t know the Wideners or other Philadelphians
aboard when he saw them.</p>

<p>Young Mr. Williams and his father were on their way here
from Geneva, Switzerland. The young man was met at the pier
in New York when the Carpathia docked by G. Heide Norris, a
cousin. Together they went to the Waldorf-Astoria, where they
remained for a few days.</p>

<p>The Rev. P. M. A. Hoque, a Catholic priest of St. Cesaire,
Canada, who was a passenger on the Carpathia, told of finding
the boats containing the survivors. He said:</p>

<p>“Every woman and child, as if by instinct, put the loops
around their bodies and drew them taut. Some of the women<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_156">{156}</a></span>
climbed the ladders. To others chairs were lowered and in these
they were lowered and in these they were lifted aboard.</p>

<p>“Not a word was spoken by any one of the rescued or the
rescuers. Everybody was too be-numbed by horror to speak. It
was a time for action and not words.</p>

<p>“Not a tear dimmed the eyes of one of the hundreds we got
on deck. The women were less excited than the men. Apparently
they all had drained their tear ducts dry, for every eye was red
and swollen.”</p>

<p>One of the most interesting accounts of the Titanic disaster
which has come to light is in a letter written on board the Carpathia
by Dr. Alice Leeder, of New York, one of the survivors,
after she had been transferred to the Carpathia in a lifeboat.</p>

<p>The letter is a personal communication addressed to Mrs.
Sarah Babcock, 2033 Walnut st., Philadelphia. By the wavering
of the handwriting one can readily realize the state of mind in
which it was written.</p>

<h3>DR. LEEDER’S LETTER.</h3>

<p>In the letter Dr. Leeder said there was no panic on board the
Titanic, and that everyone who had to meet death met it with
composure. She speaks of the generosity and kindness shown
by the crew and passengers of the Carpathia in their treatment
of the survivors. Following is the letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
“Royal Mail Steamship Carpathia,<br>
<br>
Wednesday, April 16.<br>
</p>

<p class="nind">
“My Dear Mrs. Babcock:<br>
</p>

<p>“We have been through a most terrible experience&mdash;the Titanic
and above a thousand souls sunk on Monday about 3 o’clock
in the morning. Margaret and I are safe, although we have lost
everything. One of our party, also, Mr. Kenyon, was lost. He
was such a charming man&mdash;so honorable and good.</p>

<p>“I sat talking to him a little before the accident&mdash;and a little
later he was dead. His wife is crushed by the blow. I can say<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_157">{157}</a></span>
one thing, nothing could part me from my husband in time of
danger.</p>

<p>“After floating about for four hours we were taken on board
the steamer that was bound for Naples&mdash;but she is now taking us
to New York.</p>

<p>“It is terrible to see the people who have lost their families
and friends&mdash;one lady has lost $15,000 worth of clothing, and
no one has saved anything. Many of the passengers have only
their night clothes with coats over them.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget the sight of that beautiful boat as she
went down, the orchestra playing to the last, the lights burning
until they were extinguished by the waves. It sounds so unreal,
like a scene on the stage. We were hit by an iceberg.</p>

<p>“We were in the midst of a field of ice; towers of ice; fantastic
shapes of ice! It is all photographed on my mind. There
was no panic. Everyone met death with composure&mdash;as one said
the passengers were a set of thoroughbreds.</p>

<p>“We are moving slowly toward New York. Everyone on
this boat is so kind to us. Clothing and all the necessaries are
at our convenience. I am attired in my old blue serge, a steamer
hat; truth to tell, I am a sorry looking object to land in New
York.</p>

<p>“This is rather a mixed up epistle, but please pardon lack
of clearness of expression. If you want me, some time I will come
to Philadelphia for a day or two in the future.</p>

<p class="r">
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">“With dear love,</span><br>
“ALICE J. LEEDER.”<br>
</p></div>

<p>Two handsome little boys, tiny waifs of the sea, are one of
the mysteries of the Titanic disaster. These small boys were rescued
as the big liner was foundering. Miss Hays, who has them
in charge, said:</p>

<p>“These two beautiful children speak French fluently, and
they know what their first names are, but they do not know their
last names. They are ‘Louis,’ four and a half years old, I should
say, and ‘Lump,’ a year younger.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_158">{158}</a></span></p>

<p>“They were rescued from the Titanic and brought to the
Carpathia where I was taken in another boat. Nobody knows
who they are. There was but one man in the second class cabin
who had two children with him, and that was a Mr. Hoffmann,
but no one knows any more about him than that. Whether these
are his children or not, we do not know.</p>

<p>“We in the first cabin used to see them and greatly admired
them for their beauty and sweet ways.</p>

<p>“When they were brought on board the Carpathia there were
no New York people except myself, who had not lost friends, I
was the only one in a position to befriend them, and I went to the
committee of passengers we had on board and offered to take
them to my home.</p>

<p>“They gladly gave them to me because it meant that otherwise
some society would grab them and they might be separated
and never reunited.</p>

<p>“I think that the boys are French, but perhaps Swiss,
French or Alsatian. I have tried them in Italian, German and
English, but they cannot understand. Louis, the oldest, is brown
eyed, with curly brown hair, very regular teeth and has no scar
or mark on his body that would identify him. Both are well
bred. The little fellow is just like his brother, but a year younger.
Both have very long, curling lashes.</p>

<p>“When they got up this morning they asked first thing for
a bath, and at breakfast placed their napkins under their chins
themselves. Louis came aboard wrapped in a blanket that a
sailor had given him. The other boy had a little blue coat with
white collar. Louis’s French is not a patois and he has a very
large vocabulary.</p>

<p>“I shall keep them till they are identified and make every effort
to find out who they are. Any one who can help me will win
my thanks and the thanks doubtless of some poor, stricken relatives.
It seems almost impossible that these boys can fail to be
identified in this day and generation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_159">{159}</a></span>”</p>

LIFEBOATS BUNGLINGLY HANDLED.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">Widow of College Founder Scores Management for Lack of
Drill&mdash;First Thought Damage was Slight&mdash;Aid May Have
Been Near&mdash;No Oil in Life Lamps&mdash;Hudson, N. Y., Woman’s
Pathetic Recital&mdash;A. A. Dick, of New York, Talks.</p></div>

<p>The urgent need of lifeboat drills on the trans-Atlantic liners
was touched upon by Mrs. William R. Bucknell, widow of the
founder of Bucknell University, and herself one of the survivors
of the disaster, in the course of a graphic account of the wreck
of the Titanic given by her at the home of her son-in-law, Samuel
P. Wetherill, Jr., at 23d and Spruce sts., Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bucknell said that not only were the passengers on
the Titanic absolutely unfamiliar with the life saving equipment
of the vessel, but that the equipment was inadequate and even
faulty.</p>

<p>The lifeboats were bunglingly fastened to their davits, she
said, and many of the collapsibles were too stiff to open and thus
useless for service.</p>

<p>To her the greatest crime was the “unpreparedness” of the
lifeboat equipment. Mrs. Bucknell declared one of the boats
was launched with the plug out of the bottom, and afterwards
sank, the occupants fortunately being rescued by the Titanic’s
fifth officer.</p>

<p>The lifeboat in which she was placed by Captain Smith,
she declared, was manned only by a steward and three ordinary
seamen. And none of the men, she declared, knew how to row.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bucknell also said that she had not seen a lifeboat drill
while she was aboard the Titanic, and diligent inquiry among
those rescued, after they were safely aboard the Carpathia, fail<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_160">{160}</a></span>ed
to develop any knowledge on their part of such drills ever
having been held.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bucknell said that the only provisions aboard her lifeboat
was a basket full of bread. She saw no water, although
she said that two small casks beneath one of the seats may have
contained water.</p>

<p>“The lifeboats were so bunglingly fastened to the davits in
the first place that it was hard work to get them free,” said Mrs.
Bucknell.</p>

<p>“Half the collapsible boats were so stiff that they could not
be opened and were useless. Those that were not already opened
and ready for use were unavailable, also, for none on board seemed
to understand how they worked. Hundreds more could
have been saved if these collapsible boats had worked properly.</p>

<h3>LIFEBOAT BEGINS TO FILL.</h3>

<p>“One of the lifeboats had a big hole in the bottom. A plug
had fallen out, I believe. When it was loaded and lowered over
the side into the sea it began to fill at once. At this point the
fifth officer proved himself a hero. Women in the leaking boat
were screaming with fright and tearing off their clothing in wild
and fruitless efforts to plug up the hole.</p>

<p>“The boat filled to the gunwhales before any were saved.
The brave fifth officer to my knowledge rescued nineteen of the
women in this boat, some of whom had fallen over the side into
the sea. It was finally hauled alongside and replugged, loaded
and relaunched.</p>

<p>“I was asleep in my cabin when the crash came,” said Mrs.
Bucknell, beginning her account of the disaster. “I cannot explain
just what the noise was like, except that it was horrible and
sounded like a mixture of thunder and explosions.</p>

<p>“In a moment there was a roaring sound and I knew that
something serious was the matter. The corridors filled rapidly
with frightened passengers and then the stewards and officers
came, reassuring us with the announcement that everything was
all right and that only a small hole had been stove in the bow.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_161">{161}</a></span></p>

<p>“As I stepped out of my stateroom I saw lying before me on
the floor a number of fragments of ice as big as my fists. More
was crumbled about the porthole, and it flashed over me at once
just what had happened.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>We have hit an iceberg,’ I said to my maid, ‘get dressed
at once.’</p>

<p>“We hurried into our clothes, and I took the precaution to
get fully dressed. So did my maid. I even thought to wrap myself
in my warm fur coat, for even then I felt sure we would have
to take to the boats. Something told me the damage was greater
than we had been told.</p>

<p>“My fears were realized a few minutes later when a steward
walked briskly down the corridor, calling to the passengers
who had retired again to hurry into their clothes and get on
deck at once. I could see by this man’s drawn and haggard
face that something dreadful had happened.</p>

<h3>WOULD NOT BE SEPARATED.</h3>

<p>“There was very little confusion on the deck. Once a
group of men shouted that they would not be separated from
their wives if it became necessary to take to the boats and made
a rush to find accommodations for themselves. The captain
seemed to straighten out his shoulders and his face was set with
determination.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Get back there, you cowards,’ he roared. ‘Behave yourself
like men. Look at these women. Can you not be as brave
as they?’</p>

<p>“The men fell back, and from that moment there seemed
to be a spirit of resignation all over the ship. Husbands and
wives clasped each other and burst into tears. Then a few minutes
later came the order for the women and children to take
to the boats.</p>

<p>“I did not hear an outcry from the women or the men. Wives
left their husbands’ side and without a word were led to the
boats. One little Spanish girl, a bride, was the only exception.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_162">{162}</a></span>
She wept bitterly, and it was almost necessary to drag her into
the boat. Her husband went down with the ship.</p>

<p>“The last person I remember seeing was Colonel Astor.
When he had been told by the captain that it would be impossible
for the husbands to take to the boats with their wives, he
took Mrs. Astor by the arm and they walked quietly away to
the other side of the vessel. As we pulled away I saw him leaning
tenderly over her, evidently whispering words of comfort.</p>

<p>“There were thirty-five persons in the boats in which the
captain placed me. Three of these were ordinary seamen, supposed
to manage the boat, and a steward.</p>

<p>“One of these men seemed to think that we should not start
from the sinking ship until it could be learned whether the other
boats would accommodate the rest of the women. He seemed to
think that more could be crowded into ours, if necessary.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>I would rather go back and go down with the ship than
leave under these circumstances,’ he cried.</p>

<h3>ORDERED TO PULL FOR THE LIGHT.</h3>

<p>“The captain shouted to him to obey orders and to pull for
a little light that could be just discerned miles in the distance.
I do not know what this little light was. It may have been a
passing fishing vessel, which, of course, could not know our
predicament. Anyway, we never reached it.</p>

<p>“We rowed all night. I took an oar and sat beside the
Countess de Rothes. Her maid had an oar and so did mine. The
air was freezing cold, and it was not long before the only man
that appeared to know anything about rowing commenced to
complain that his hands were freezing.</p>

<p>“A woman back of him handed him a shawl from about her
shoulders.</p>

<p>“As we rowed we looked back at the lights of the Titanic.
There was not a sound from her, only the lights began to get lower
and lower, and finally she sank. Then we heard a muffled explosion
and a dull roar caused by the great suction of water.</p>

<p>“There was not a drop of water on our boat. The last min<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_163">{163}</a></span>ute
before our boat was launched Captain Smith threw a bag of
bread aboard. I took the precaution of taking a good drink of
water before we started, so I suffered no inconvenience from
thirst.</p>

<p>“Another thing that I must not forget to mention, it is but
additional proof of my charge that the Titanic was poorly equipped.
The lamp on our boat was nearly devoid of oil.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>For God’s sake, keep that wick turned down low, or you
will be in complete darkness,’ we were told on leaving. It wasn’t
long before these words proved true, and before daylight we
were dependent on a cane one of the women had brought along,
which contained a tiny electric lamp.</p>

<h3>FOUGHT THEIR WAY THROUGH THE DARKNESS.</h3>

<p>“With this little glow worm we fought our way through
the darkness. I rowed for an hour straight ahead. Then I rested
and some one else took my place. Then I grasped the oars again.
I have had lots of experience in this form of exercise, and at my
place in the Adirondacks am at it continually, so, contrary to
stories that have been written, I did not blister my hands.</p>

<p>“I want to say right here that I did not manage the boat.
I helped row it and that’s all.</p>

<p>“We had rowed about ten miles when looking over Countess
Rothe’s oar I spied a faint light to the rear.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>What’s that light?’ I almost screamed.</p>

<p>“One of the sailors looked where I indicated and said: ‘It’s
a ship&mdash;I can tell by the lights on her masthead.’</p>

<p>“As we passed over the spot where the Titanic had gone
down we saw nothing but a sheet of yellow scum and a solitary
log. There was not a body, not a thing to indicate that there
had been a wreck. The sun was shining brightly then, and we
were near to the Carpathia.”</p>

<p>Mrs. K. T. Andrews, of Hudson, N. Y., a first class passenger
on the Titanic, said:</p>

<p>“When our boat was away from the Titanic there was an
explosion and the Titanic seemed to break in two. Then she<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_164">{164}</a></span>
sank, bow first. Just before this, I saw Mr. Astor, Mr. Thayer
and Mr. Case standing on deck. They were smiling and as we
went off they waved their hands.”</p>

<p>Thomas Whitley, a waiter on the Titanic, who was sent to
a hospital with a fractured leg, was asleep five decks below the
main saloon deck. He ran upstairs and saw the iceberg towering
high above the forward deck of the Titanic.</p>

<p>“It looked like a giant mountain of glass,” said Whitley. “I
saw that we were in for it. Almost immediately I heard that
stokehold No. 11 was filling with water and that the ship was
doomed. The water-tight doors had been closed, but the officers,
fearing that there might be an explosion below decks, called for
volunteers to go below to draw the fires.</p>

<h3>COULD ALMOST FEEL THE WATER RUSHING IN.</h3>

<p>“Twenty men stepped forward almost immediately and started
down. To permit them to enter the hold it was necessary for
the doors to be opened again, and after that one could almost
feel the water rushing in. It was but a few minutes later when
all hands were ordered on deck with lifebelts. It was then known
for a certain fact that the ship was doomed.”</p>

<p>Charles Williams, the racquet coach at Harrow, Eng., who
is the professional champion of the world and was coming to
New York to defend his title, said he was in the smoking-room
when the boat struck. He rushed out, saw the iceberg, which
seemed to loom above the deck over a hundred feet. It broke
up amidship and floated away.</p>

<p>He jumped from the boat deck on the starboard side as
far away from the steamer as possible. He was nine hours in the
small boat, standing in water to his knees. He said “the sailors
conducted themselves admirably.”</p>

<p>A. A. Dick, of New York, said:</p>

<p>“Everybody in the first and second cabin behaved splendidly.
The members of the crew also behaved magnificently. But
some men in the third class, presumably passengers, were shot<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_165">{165}</a></span>
by some of the officers. Who these men were we do not know.
There was a rush for the lifeboats.</p>

<p>“It was fully an hour after the boat struck that the lifeboats
were launched. This was due to the fact that those aboard had
not the slightest idea that the ship would sink.”</p>

<p>George Rheims, of 417 Fifth avenue, New York, was on
the Titanic with his brother-in-law, Joseph Holland Loring, of
London. He said no one seemed to know for twenty minutes
after the boat struck that anything had happened. Many of the
passengers stood round for an hour with their life belts on, he
said, and saw people getting in the boats.</p>

<p>When all the boats had gone, he added, he shook hands
with his brother-in-law, who would not jump, and leaped over
the side of the boat.</p>

<h3>BOAT HALF UNDER WATER.</h3>

<p>He swam for a quarter of an hour and reached a boat and
climbed in. He found the boat, with eighteen occupants, half
under water. The people were in water up to their knees. Seven
of them, he said, died during the night.</p>

<p>The sufferings of the Titanic’s passengers when taken off
the lifeboats by the Carpathia were told by John Kuhl, of Omaha,
Neb., who was a passenger on the latter vessel. Many of the
women, he said, were scantily clad and all were suffering from
the cold. Four died on the Carpathia as a result of the exposure.</p>

<p>“In spite of the suffering and the crowded condition of the
boats,” said Mr. Kuhl, “the utmost heroism was displayed by
all of the unfortunates. When they were lifted to the deck of
the Carpathia many of the women broke down completely, and
there were many touching scenes. Many of the women were incoherent
and several were almost insane.”</p>

<p>Of all the heroes who went to their death when the Titanic
dived to its ocean grave, none, in the opinion of Miss Hilda Slater,
a passenger in the last boat to put off, deserved greater credit
that the members of the vessel’s orchestra.</p>

<p>According to Miss Slater, the orchestra played until the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_166">{166}</a></span>
last. When the vessel took its final plunge the strains of a lively
air mingled gruesomely with the cries of those who realized
that they were face to face with death.</p>

<p>Mrs. Edgar J. Meyer, of New York, said:</p>

<p>“It was a clear and star-lit night. When the ship struck
we were in our cabin. I was afraid and made my husband promise
if there was trouble he would not make me leave him. We
walked around the deck a while.</p>

<p>“An officer came up and cried: ‘All women into the lifeboats.’
My husband and I discussed it&mdash;and the officer said:
‘You must obey orders.’ We went down into the cabin and we
decided on account of our baby to part. He helped me put on
warm things.</p>

<p>“I got into a boat, but there were no sailors aboard. An
English girl and I rowed for four hours and a half. Then we
were picked up at 6 o’clock in the morning.”</p>

<h3>THERE WERE TWO EXPLOSIONS.</h3>

<p>Hugh Wellner, a son of Thomas Wellner, R. A., of London,
says there were two explosions before the Titanic made her dive
into the sea. Wellner believes he was the last person to leave
the Titanic.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander T. Compton and her daughter, Miss Alice
Compton, of New Orleans, two of the Titanic’s rescued, reached
New York completely prostrated over the loss of Mrs. Compton’s
son, Alexander, who went down with the big liner.</p>

<p>“When we waved good-bye to my son,” said Mrs. Compton,
“we did not realize the great danger, but thought we were
only being sent out in the boats as a precautionary measure.
When Captain Smith handed us life preservers he said cheerily:
‘They will keep you warm if you do not have to use them.’
Then the crew began clearing the boats and putting the women
into them. My daughter and I were lifted in the boat commanded
by the fifth officer. There was a moan of agony and anguish
from those in our boat when the Titanic sank, and we insisted<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_167">{167}</a></span>
that the officer head back for the place where the Titanic had
disappeared.</p>

<p>“We found one man with a life preserver on him struggling
in the cold water, and for a moment I thought that he was my
son.”</p>

<p>That all possible means were taken to prevent the male
passengers on board the Titanic from going away in lifeboats
and allowing the women and children to perish is the tale told
by Miss Lily Bentham, of Rochester, N. Y., a second class passenger,
who said she saw shots fired at men who endeavored to
get away.</p>

<p>Miss Bentham was in a hysterical condition when the Carpathia
landed, and was unable to give a full account of what happened,
but Mrs. W. J. Douton, a fellow passenger, who also
comes from Rochester, and who lost her husband, told about
what took place.</p>

<h3>PACKED LIKE SARDINES IN THE BOAT.</h3>

<p>“I had not been in bed half an hour,” said Mrs. Douton,
“when the steward rushed down to our cabin and told us to put
on our clothes and come upon deck. We were thrown into lifeboats
and packed like sardines. As soon as the men passengers
tried to get to the boats they were shot at.</p>

<p>“I don’t know who did the shooting. We rowed frantically
away from the ship and were tied to four other boats. I arose
and saw the ship sinking.</p>

<p>“The band was playing ‘Nearer, My God, to Thee.’ There
was a baby in the boat with one of the women. The baby’s hands
had been cut off. I think it was still alive. The mother did not
give it up. During the night, when waiting for the Carpathia,
four of the crew died in the boat and were thrown overboard.</p>

<p>“It was bitter cold, and we had to wait until 8 o’clock in the
morning before being taken off by the lifeboats of the Carpathia.”</p>

<p>John R. Joyce, a banker of Carslbad, N. M., a passenger on
the Carpathia, said: “When the Carpathia reached the scene<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_168">{168}</a></span>
of the wreck we saw eighteen boats and one raft on the water.
The Carpathia picked them all up. Four persons on the raft
were dead. They were buried at sea on our way back to New
York. A survivor told me that some of the Titanic’s passengers
jumped for the lifeboats, missed them and were drowned. I
heard nothing of Major Butt.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dickinson Bishop, of Detroit, declared that she was
the first woman in the first boat. “We floated around a half
mile or so from the scene of the disaster for four hours before
we were picked up by the Carpathia,” she said.</p>

<p>“I was in bed when the crash came. I was not much alarmed,
but decided to dress and go on deck. By the time I was
dressed everything seemed quiet, and I lay down in my berth
again, assured that there was no danger. I rose again at the
summons of a stewardess. There were very few passengers on
the deck when I reached there.</p>

<h3>DISCIPLINE WAS PERFECT.</h3>

<p>“There was no panic and the discipline of the Titanic’s crew
was perfect. My husband joined me on the Carpathia, and we
knelt together and thanked God for our preservation.”</p>

<p>That the stokers of the Titanic were the first to realize the
seriousness of the accident and came rushing pell mell to the
upper decks for safety was the tale related by one of the survivors
to John R. Joyce, a passenger aboard the Carpathia, who
hails from Carlsbad, N. M.</p>

<p>“Soon after the crash,” said Mr. Joyce, “I was told that
about a dozen stokers came scrambling to the upper decks.
They were whispering excitedly and edging their way cautiously
toward one of the lifeboats. Suddenly and without consulting
any of the officers of the ship they climbed into the lifeboat and
were off before any others of the crew were the wiser.”</p>

<p>George Biorden, of California, had this to say:</p>

<p>“I was beside Henry B. Harris, the theatrical manager,
when he bade his wife good-bye. Both started toward the side
of the boat where a lifeboat was being lowered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_169">{169}</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Harris was told it was the rule for women to leave
the boat first. ‘Yes, I know, I will stay,’ Harris said. Shortly
after the lifeboats left a man jumped overboard. Other men followed.
It was like sheep following a leader.</p>

<p>“Captain Smith was washed from the bridge into the ocean.
He swam to where a baby was drowning and carried it in his
arms while he swam to a lifeboat, which was manned by officers
of the Titanic. He surrendered the baby to them and swam back
to the steamer.</p>

<p>“About the time Captain Smith got back there was an explosion.
The entire ship trembled. I had secured a life preserver
and jumped over. I struck a piece of ice but was not injured.</p>

<p>“I swam about sixty yards from the steamer when there
was a series of explosions. I looked back and saw the Titanic
go down, bow first. Hundreds of persons were in the water at
the time. When the great steamer went down they shrieked
hysterically.”</p>

<h3>MRS. PAUL SCHABERT’S STORY.</h3>

<p>Mrs. Paul Schabert, of Derby, Conn., said:</p>

<p>“I was in stateroom No. 28, on the port side and was asleep
at the time of the collision. The shock awoke me, but there
seemed no excitement and people were walking about in orderly
fashion, many stateroom doors being opened simply to permit
inquiries as to the cause of the shock.</p>

<p>“Then in the midst of all this quiet, came the startling cry
of ‘Ladies first,’ and it was the first intimation of danger that
we had. Many of us, however, went back to our staterooms
to dress, and did it in rather leisurely fashion, until the order
was passed that women must leave their husbands, brothers and
other male relations and take to the lifeboats.</p>

<p>“By this time the ship’s orchestra had been ordered to play
as the lifeboats were sent away from the Titanic’s side. I refused
to leave unless my brother also was permitted to go with
me.</p>

<p>“I stood aside and saw about a dozen boats rowed away and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_170">{170}</a></span>
several times officers of the boat tried to persuade me to go
along. When the next to the last lifeboat was ready to leave,
there was not another woman in sight and the word was passed
that I might take Philip with me.</p>

<p>“The Titanic sank about 1.50 o’clock Monday morning, and
it was 6 o’clock the same morning that the Carpathia put in an
appearance and we were picked up. We were probably a mile
from the Titanic’s grave when taken aboard the Carpathia.”</p>

<p>C. H. Romaine, Georgetown, Ky., tells his story as follows:</p>

<p>“I had just retired for the night when the Titanic crashed
to its doom. The jar was so slight that not much attention was
paid to it. Before going on deck I was told that there was not
the slightest danger.</p>

<p>“Forty-five minutes afterwards we were told that the vessel
was sinking. Men, women and children were gathered together
on deck. Men stood aside to let the women and children take
their places in the boats. The men who remained behind were
confident that the Titanic would float for hours. I was commanded
to row in one of the first boats that left the ship.</p>

<p>“We passed out of sight of the Titanic before she sank,
but distinctly heard the explosion.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_171">{171}</a></span>”</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br><br>
NOT LIKE BOURGOGNE DISASTER.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">Lone Woman Survivor Makes Comparison&mdash;Does Not Like
“Law of the Sea”&mdash;Families First, It Should Be, She Says&mdash;Husband
Greeted Like the Hero He Was&mdash;Privations and
Horror Hasten Death.</p></div>

<p>Whenever men speak of tragedies of the sea, the story of
La Bourgogne, the French Line steamship, which was sunk in
collision with the British ship Cormartyshire, is always recalled.
The conduct of the French sailors upon that occasion is held up
as a shining example of what the behavior of a crew should not
be. It even appears more reprehensible in the light of comparison
with the heroism and noble sacrifices of the male passengers
and crew who went down with the Titanic.</p>

<p>There were 584 persons drowned in the wreck, and only
one woman was saved. She was saved by her husband, who
seems to have been the only man in all that great company who
showed his manhood in the face of that overwhelming disaster.</p>

<p>This hero was Adrien Lacasse, a young French teacher,
of Plainfield, N. J. He died three years ago in New York,
pneumonia being given as the immediate cause of death. His
friends know that the horrors through which he had gone so
weakened his constitution that he could not withstand the illness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Victoire Lacasse is living quietly in this city with her
son Robert, who was born after the disaster.</p>

<p>Time has not erased the lines left by the tragedy in her
face, and only a glance at that sad, patient face tells the story
of her suffering.</p>

<p>Since the news of the wreck of the Titanic came she has not
dared to remain alone with her thoughts, but has always had<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_172">{172}</a></span>
some friend near her when it was possible, and when it was
not has found comfort in talking to them over the telephone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lacasse has written the story of the Bourgogne. She
has taken occasion in this story to protest against the “rule of
the sea” which provides for “women and children first.”</p>

<p>On the contrary, she believes that it should be “families
first,” and says that she would rather have gone down with her
husband than have been saved without him. Mrs. Lacasse’s
story follows:</p>

<p>I have read only the headlines about the wreck of the Titanic.
That is all that I had to read. The rest I know. I
can see all the things that happened aboard the big funeral ship
as vividly as if I had been aboard her when she collided head-on
with the iceberg.</p>

<h3>WENT DOWN OFF SABLE ISLAND.</h3>

<p>I can even picture the ocean, the day and all the surroundings,
because, as many will recall, it was just off Sable Island
that La Bourgogne went to her grave on July 4, 1898, the same
day that all America was rejoicing over its victory in the Spanish-American
War.</p>

<p>I have the most heartfelt sympathy for the bereaved, unfortunate
survivors of this last terrible wreck. It has always seemed
to me a great mistake to compel women and children to be
saved first. How much better it would be to save entire families
than to have so many widows and children.</p>

<p>I know that I should have preferred going down with my
husband to being saved without him. The women and children
from the Titanic, who have just passed through this ordeal of
being separated from their husbands and fathers, stepping into
little boats and looking back on their loved ones for the last
time, must feel just as I do.</p>

<p>Why should the rule of the sea supersede the marriage vow,
“until death do us part.”</p>

<p>The story of La Bourgogne has been told and retold so
often, and there have been so many different versions of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_173">{173}</a></span>
wreck, that I do not believe that the public understands the
truth yet. For one thing, I think too much stress has been laid
upon the alleged brutality of the crew.</p>

<p>While it is undoubtedly true that they were untrained and
undisciplined, and were not at their proper stations, I don’t
believe that they fought back the women and children with
their knives. It was the men in the steerage who did these
things.</p>

<p>We boarded La Bourgogne on Saturday, July 2, from New
York. The steamship was bound for Havre. My husband, who,
I may mention, had served ten years in the French navy, wanted
to spend the summer months with his parents.</p>

<p>The first two days we had beautiful weather. Sunday night
I could not sleep, recalling the stories of the passengers as I did.
At one o’clock on Monday morning I awakened my husband,
telling him that I heard a foghorn.</p>

<h3>THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR.</h3>

<p>He laughed and tried to comfort me by saying that we had
a good boat and that Captain Deloncle was a good captain and
there was nothing to fear. I insisted and told him that I would
not go to sleep unless he went up on deck to make certain that
everything was all right.</p>

<p>My husband dressed himself and went up on deck. He
did not come down to our cabin again until half-past four and
then he threw himself, all dressed, upon the bed. I called to
him again that I heard the foghorn, which had been blowing
all that time. He went to the port hole to look out.</p>

<p>He had hardly done so when the crash came and he was
thrown violently on his back. He was on his feet in a minute,
and half dragged me out of bed. Then he put a life preserver
on me and another on himself.</p>

<p>Then we both went on deck, my husband taking several
other life preservers with him and leaving them on the deck for
others. Some men from the steerage saw us and evidently<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_174">{174}</a></span>
thought that we had the best life preservers, because they came
at us with their knives. I screamed and they went away.</p>

<p>Meanwhile some sailors and passengers were trying to
launch boats on the other side of the ship. My husband tried
to help them, but there was no use. The ship was listing too
much.</p>

<p>I cannot describe much of what happened on board after
this, as my husband cried to me to close my eyes if I would keep
my senses. I do remember hearing the captain shouting orders,
but I don’t believe they were being obeyed. We ran to the stern
and climbed aboard a raft.</p>

<p>Immediately after this the raft slipped from under us into
the water and left us hanging on the rail of the steamer. Then
we both fell into the water backwards. My husband swam to the
raft with me. He climbed on it first and then dragged me up
after him.</p>

<h3>EVERYONE FIGHTING EVERYONE ELSE.</h3>

<p>We were the first people on the raft, but it wasn’t long before
we were surrounded by the men from the boats. Everyone
was fighting everyone else to get on the raft and to keep the
others from getting on.</p>

<p>It was more horrible than the most realistic nightmare.
About twenty men had managed to get on our raft, which was
built to hold ten.</p>

<p>The buoys of the raft were already under water and the
raft was nearly sinking. An old man swam to us. The men
shouted to push him off if he tried to get on, but my husband
wouldn’t do it and pulled him on board.</p>

<p>He was a Mr. Achard, of Baltimore, and had lost his wife,
his son and his daughter in the wreck.</p>

<p>We were drifting helplessly around, no one knowing what
to do, when my husband said that there must be a pair of oars on
the raft. He felt underneath and found a pair, so the men were
able to row out of danger.</p>

<p>The ship first went down up to the stern, but righted up.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_175">{175}</a></span>
Then the bow arose above the water almost like a porpoise. The
ship went slowly down. We saw the captain on his bridge.</p>

<p>We saw the water come up and up until it almost reached
him. Then we heard a pistol shot. Many people thought that
he had shot himself, but it was simply his last call for help. He
went down with his boat.</p>

<p>It had been just forty minutes after the collision that La
Bourgogne took her final dive. Then suddenly men, women and
children, some of them still alive, were spouted out like sticks in
a boiling volume. Those poor creatures, those who had the
strength, would swim to the rafts and beg to be taken aboard,
and, being denied, turn and disappear into the ocean.</p>

<p>Presently the sun broke through the heavy fog and the great
curtain lifted. The surface of the ocean, which had been disturbed
by great swells, became as calm as a millpond. It was a beautiful
summer’s day. There was nothing to indicate that a great
tragedy had just been enacted on these waters.</p>

<h3>NEARLY AN HOUR BEFORE RELIEF CAME.</h3>

<p>Our men pulled at the oars and after some hours we came in
sight of the Cromartyshire. There were two boats from La
Bourgogne tied to her stern, but it was nearly an hour before
they sent a boat for us. When they did I would not get into one
and they towed us to the side, where I was helped aboard.</p>

<p>When wireless telegraphy was discovered I thought that
great wrecks would be impossible, but the fate of the Titanic has
shown us differently. We must rely upon lifeboats and life preservers.
I think every person should learn how to put on a life
preserver when he goes on board a vessel. He can not learn
when the ship starts to sink. My husband said that nearly all
could have been saved from La Bourgogne if they had put on
life belts and kept cool.</p>

<p>Adrien Lacasse was greeted as a returning hero. On his trip
through Canada to this city, he was besieged by people who wanted
to see him and shake hands with him. He pulled down the
shade of the window in his car to avoid notoriety. The crowds<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_176">{176}</a></span>
shook hands with an American woman, who sat behind him, believing
that she was Mrs. Lacasse.</p>

<p>Mothers named their babies after him, and from all corners
of the earth came letters of praise. He was a hero because he
kept cool, and was the only man who did. The heroes of the Titanic
can not be counted. They all kept their heads, so far as is
known, but their only reward was the knowledge that they had
not been cowards in the face of death.</p>

<p>Standing in a circle in the engine room of the Titanic as she
went down, with hands clasping those of their comrades and all
praying, the gallant thirty-three engine men of the wounded vessel
met their death.</p>

<p>The tragic story of their bravery in the face of what they
must have known was certain death was told by Thomas Hardy,
chief steward of the Titanic, as he left for England, a passenger
on board the Red Star Line steamship Lapland.</p>

<h3>SCENE THAT HARDY WITNESSED.</h3>

<p>His voice breaking with emotion, Hardy told the story of
the scene that he and other stewards witnessed from the galleries
overlooking the engine room.</p>

<p>“When the order that every man should take his post, as the
vessel was sinking, was sent through the Titanic,” said Hardy,
“there were eleven men on duty in the hold.</p>

<p>“The twenty others, without the least hesitancy, came hurrying
to their posts beside the engines and dynamos. They must
have known as well as Captain Smith that the Titanic was going
down, for when they arrived in the engine room the water was rising
over the floor. There was nothing for them to do but to keep
the dynamos running.</p>

<p>“Not one of them moved to quit their posts and not one
would have dared to, even they had been willing, in the face of
the stern men who had chosen to die there. Yet they could be of
no use, for the Titanic was going down then.</p>

<p>“The water was rising about them when I looked down from
a gallery. I saw the little circle of Chief Engineer Bell and sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_177">{177}</a></span>
of his men standing there in the water with their lips moving in
prayer. I pray that I may never see the like of it again; it was
real heroism.”</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the clearest stories of the disaster was told
by Albert Smith, steward of the Titanic. Smith was one of the
number of six members of the crew of the sunken liner who manned
boat No. 11, which carried fifty women and no men other than
the half dozen necessary to row it to safety.</p>

<p>“From the time that the first boat pushed off,” he said, “until
ten minutes before the Titanic sank, the band was playing. They
played light music, waltzes and popular airs at first.</p>

<p>“The last thing they played was ‘Nearer, My God, to Thee.’
The voices of the men on board joining in the singing came perfectly
clear over the water. It was so horrible it was unbelievable.
You kept thinking you would wake up.</p>

<p>“I saw First Officer Murdock, of the Titanic, shoot himself.
It was Murdock who was on the bridge when the ship struck.</p>

<h3>DID NOT THINK IT SERIOUS.</h3>

<p>“I was in my bunk when the crash came. It was not much of
a shock. Of course, I knew something had happened, but it never
dawned on me there was anything serious.</p>

<p>“I threw on a few clothes, hurriedly, though according to
drill, and went to boat No. 11, which was my place in case of
emergency. I stood there until one of the officers came by and
said there was no danger and that the men might return to their
bunks. I was partly undressed again when the second call came.</p>

<p>“I went back to my post at No. 11 and we prepared to lower
the small boats. We had made 565 miles during the day and
the Titanic was running at the rate of twenty-three knots an hour
when she struck. My boat station was on the promenade deck. I
want to say right here that there was no confusion or panic while
the boats were being filled.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, there was no particular rush for the
boats, because it did not enter the heads of any at first that the
Titanic could actually sink.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_178">{178}</a></span></p>

<p>“Many believed it was safer to stay on board the big liner,
even wounded as she was, than to trust themselves to the boats.
When we had filled our boat we lowered. We had about fifty
women with us, which crowded our small craft, so that we were
only able to man our oars very slowly and clumsily. In consequence
of this we were not more than a half mile from the Titanic
when she sunk.</p>

<p>“We saw her plainly all the time, and whatever anybody else
may say, believe me, her lights were gleaming until about five
minutes before she went down. The night was clear and cold and
calm and so bright that the many stars were reflected in the sea.</p>

<p>“We put off into a field of small ice. The berg we had struck
was plainly visible. The Titanic struck a large, jagged, submerged
portion of the berg, on the port side; as she slowly slid
back and away from the mountain of ice it passed her on the starboard
side and went slowly on its way.</p>

<h3>IT WAS APPALLING.</h3>

<p>“As I say, we rowed slowly because of our heavy cargo. The
Titanic settled slowly at first. When she got going, though, she
went rapidly. It was appalling. I do not think any of us really
believed until her final lurch that she would actually sink.</p>

<p>“She started to go down bow first. She dove like that until
her propeller was out of water. Everybody rushed to the stern
of the boat. You could see them climbing and clinging to the
higher places. Suddenly the Titanic gave a frightful lurch. Hundreds
of those on the stern were flung into the air.</p>

<p>“They looked like a swarm of bees; little and black. Then
the Titanic broke, snapped in the middle and the boilers blew up
and the engines dropped out with a frightful noise. She sank
practically in two pieces, broken directly in half. There was little
or no swirl or intake. I do not think any of the boats were drawn
down.</p>

<p>“Murdock stood on the promenade deck when the last boat
pushed off. Captain Smith had taken charge of the bridge. Mur<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_179">{179}</a></span>dock
put a pistol to his right temple and fired. I saw him do it.
And I saw him drop.</p>

<p>“Now I have just one dollar and twenty-five cents left tied
up in a corner of my handkerchief. I was going to take that to
cable one word. It will cost me one dollar to cable “Safe,” but I
have a mother who is walking the streets of London waiting for
that one word.”</p>

<p>The survivors of the Titanic are still paying a tribute without
precedent to the bravery of the men and women of the wrecked
liner, steerage passenger, stoker and millionaire.</p>

<p>Major Archibald Butt, U. S. A., military aide to President
Taft, met his death in a manner that fully justified the President’s
estimation of him as expressed in the eulogy given out at the
White House, in which the President tenderly referred to his late
aide as a man “gentle and considerate,” and as one who was
“every inch a soldier.”</p>

<h3>MAJOR BUTT AN OFFICER OF THE TITANIC.</h3>

<p>From the moment that Captain Smith let it be known to his
officers and a few of the men passengers that the Titanic was
doomed, Major Butt was an officer of the Titanic.</p>

<p>He was here and there and everywhere, giving words of encouragement
to weeping women and children, and uttering,
when necessary, commands to keep weak-kneed men from giving
in and rendering the awful situation even more terrible.</p>

<p>That this was the manner in which Major Butt met death is
certain. Captain Charles E. Crain, of the Twenty-seventh United
States Infantry, was a passenger on the Carpathia, and when he
learned that Major Butt was among the dead, he made it his duty
to get the true tale of his comrade’s death.</p>

<p>“Naturally,” said Captain Crain, “I was deeply concerned in
the fate of Major Butt, for he was not only a fellow-officer of the
army; but also a personal friend of many years’ standing.</p>

<p>“I questioned those of the survivors who were in a condition
to talk, and from them I learned that Butt, when the Titanic
struck, took his position with the officers and from the moment<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_180">{180}</a></span>
that the order to man the lifeboats was given until the last one
was dropped into the sea, he aided in the maintenance of discipline
and the placing of the women and children in the boats.</p>

<p>“Butt, I was told, was as cool as the iceberg that had doomed
the ship, and not once did he lose control of himself. In the
presence of death he was the same gallant, courteous officer that
the American people had learned to know so well as a result of
his constant attendance upon President Taft.</p>

<p>“There was never any chance of Butt getting into any of
those lifeboats. He knew his time was at hand, and he was ready
to meet it as a man should, and I and all of the others who
cherish his memory are glad that he faced the situation that way,
which was the only possible way a man of his calibre could face
it.”</p>

<p>“This is a man’s game, and I will play it to the end,” was
the word that Benjamin Guggenheim, the millionaire smelter
magnate, sent to his wife from the ill-fated Titanic.</p>

<h3>NO CHANCE OF ESCAPING.</h3>

<p>The message was delivered to the stricken widow by John
Johnson, the room steward, to whom it was given. Guggenheim,
Johnson said, realized almost from the beginning that
there was no chance of escaping. He sent for Johnson, who he
knew was an expert swimmer, and for his secretary, and asked
them if they should be saved to get word to Mrs. Guggenheim.</p>

<p>“Tell her, Johnson,” the steward relates, “that I played the
game straight and that no woman was left on board this ship
because Benjamin Guggenheim was a coward. Tell her that my
last thoughts were of her and the girls.”</p>

<p>Guggenheim, according to Johnson, lit a cigar and sauntered
up to the boat deck to help load the lifeboats. He afterward
returned to the main deck and was engulfed with the ship.</p>

<p>“Mr. Guggenheim was one of my charges,” said the steward
anew. “He had his secretary with him. His name was
Giglio, I believe, an Armenian, about twenty-four years old.
Both died like men.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_181">{181}</a></span></p>

<p>“When the crash came I awakened them and told them to
get dressed. A few minutes later I went into their rooms and
helped them to get ready. I put a life preserver on Mr. Guggenheim.
He said it hurt him in the back. There was plenty of time
and I took it off, adjusted it, and then put it on him again. It
was all right this time.</p>

<p>“They wanted to get out on deck with only a few clothes
on, but I pulled a heavy sweater over Mr. Guggenheim’s lifebelt,
and then they both went out.</p>

<p>“They stayed together and I could see what they were doing.
They were going from one lifeboat to another helping the
women and children. Mr. Guggenheim would shout out, ‘Women
first,’ and he was of great assistance to the officers.</p>

<h3>THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT.</h3>

<p>“Things weren’t so bad at first, but when I saw Mr. Guggenheim
about three-quarters of an hour after the crash there was
great excitement. What surprised me was that both Mr. Guggenheim
and his secretary were dressed in their evening clothes.
They had deliberately taken off their sweaters, and as nearly as I
can remember they wore no lifebelts at all.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>What’s that for?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>We’ve dressed up in our best,’ replied Mr. Guggenheim,
and are prepared to go down like gentlemen.’ It was then he
told me about the message to his wife and that is what I have
come here for.</p>

<p>“Well, shortly after the last few boats were lowered and I
was ordered by the deck officer to man an oar, I waved good-bye
to Mr. Guggenheim, and that was the last I saw of him and his
secretary.”</p>

<p>Taking refuge on the bridge of the ill-fated Titanic, two
little children remained by the side of Captain Smith until that
portion of the big ship had been swept by water. Survivors of
the crew who went down with the Titanic, but were saved by
clinging to an overturned lifeboat, told of their gallant commander’s
effort to save the life of one of the children. He died<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_182">{182}</a></span>
a sailor’s death, and the little girl who had intrusted her life to his
care died with him.</p>

<p>“He held the little girl under one arm,” said James McGann,
a fireman, “as he jumped into the sea and endeavored to reach
the nearest lifeboat with the child. I took the other child into
my arms as I was swept from the bridge deck. When I plunged
into the cold water I was compelled to release my hold on the
child, and I am satisfied that the same thing happened to Captain
Smith.</p>

<p>“I had gone to the bridge deck to assist in lowering a collapsible
boat. The water was then coming over the bridge, and
we were unable to launch the boat properly. It was overturned
and was used as a life raft, some thirty or more of us, mostly firemen,
clinging to it. Captain Smith looked as though he was trying
to keep back the tears as he thought of the doomed ship.</p>

<h3>EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF.</h3>

<p>“He turned to the men lowering the boat and shouted: ‘Well,
boys, it’s every man for himself.’ He then took one of the children
standing by him on the bridge and jumped into the sea. He
endeavored to reach the overturned boat, but did not succeed.
That was the last I saw of Captain Smith.”</p>

<p>Other graphic accounts of the final plunge of the Titanic
were related by two Englishmen, survivors by the merest chance.
One of them struggled for hours to hold himself afloat on an
overturned collapsible lifeboat, to one end of which John B.
Thayer, Jr., of Philadelphia, whose father perished, hung until
rescued.</p>

<p>The men give their names as A. H. Barkworth, justice of the
peace of East Riding, Yorkshire, England, and W. J. Mellors, of
Christ Church Terrace, Chelsea, London. The latter, a young
man, had started for this country with his savings to seek his
fortune, and lost all but his life.</p>

<p>Mellors says Captain Smith, of the Titanic, did not commit
suicide. The captain jumped from the bridge, Mellors declares,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_183">{183}</a></span>
and he heard him say to his officers and crew: “You have done
your duty, boys. Now every man for himself.”</p>

<p>Mellors and Barkworth, both declare there were three distinct
explosions before the Titanic broke in two, and bow section
first, and stern part last, settled with her human cargo into
the sea.</p>

<p>Her four whistles kept up a deafening blast until the explosions,
declare the men. The death cries from the shrill throats
of the blatant steam screechers beside the smokestacks so rent
the air that conversation among the passengers was possible only
when one yelled into the ear of a fellow unfortunate.</p>

<p>“I did not know the Thayer family well,” declared Mr. Barkworth,
“but I had met young Thayer, a clean-cut chap, and his
father on the trip. I did not see Mr. Thayer throw his son from
the ship, but the lad and I struggled in the water for several
hours endeavoring to hold afloat by grabbing to the sides and end
of an overturned lifeboat.</p>

<h3>KEPT AFLOAT BY FUR OVERCOAT.</h3>

<p>“I consider my fur overcoat helped to keep me afloat. I had
a life preserver under it, under my arms, but it would not have
held me up so well out of the water but for the coat. The fur of
the coat seemed not to get wet through and retained a certain
amount of air that added to buoyancy. I shall never part with it.</p>

<p>“The testimony of J. Bruce Ismay, managing director of the
White Star Line, that he had not heard explosions before the Titanic
settled, indicates that he must have gotten some distance
from her in his lifeboat.</p>

<p>“There were three distinct explosions and the ship broke in
the centre. The bow settled headlong first and the stern last. I
was looking toward her from the raft to which young Thayer and
I had clung.</p>

<p>“I thought I was doomed to go down with the rest. I stood
on the deck, awaiting my fate, fearing to jump from the ship.
Then came a grinding noise, followed by two others, and I was
hurled into the deep. Great waves engulfed me, but I was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_184">{184}</a></span>
drawn toward the ship, so that I believe there was little suction.
I swam about for more than one hour before I was picked up
by a boat.”</p>

<p>Confirming the statements made by J. Bruce Ismay, managing
director of the White Star Line, before the Senatorial Investigating
Committee in New York, William E. Carter, of
Philadelphia, who was saved, together with his wife and two
children, declared that J. Bruce Ismay had not acted like a coward
but instead had aided in placing women and children in
the boats and had gotten into the last one himself only after he
had failed to find any more women after calling for several
minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter related his experience on the Titanic from the
time the ship struck the mountain of ice until he left the ill-fated
vessel on the last lifeboat a short time before she went to her
doom.</p>

<h3>UNJUST TO MR. ISMAY.</h3>

<p>Mr. Carter declared that the statements which have been
made by many persons regarding Mr. Ismay’s conduct were an
injustice to him and added that the head of the White Star Line
felt extremely sad following the collision and the subsequent
sinking of the world’s largest steamer.</p>

<p>He said that while the lifeboat containing himself and Ismay
was moving away from the Titanic, Ismay rowed with two seamen
and himself until they sighted the Carpathia.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting statements made by Mr. Carter
was that a short time before he left the ship he spoke to Harry
E. Widener and advised him to get into one of the boats if he
could. Mr. Widener replied: “I think I’ll stick to the big ship,
Billy, and take a chance.”</p>

<p>Relating his experiences, Mr. Carter said: “I was in the
smoking room for several hours prior to the collision with Major
Archie Butt, Colonel Gracie, Harry Widener, Mr. Thayer,
Clarence Moore, of Washington; William Dulles and several other
men.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_185">{185}</a></span></p>

<p>“At exactly seventeen minutes to 12 o’clock we felt a jar and
left the room to see what the trouble was outside. We were told
that the ship had struck an iceberg. Many of the men were in
the card room, and after learning what had happened returned to
their games.</p>

<p>“The officers informed us that the accident was not a serious
one, and there was little excitement at the time. However, I
went to the lower deck, where Mrs. Carter and my two children
were sleeping. I awoke my wife and told her what had occurred
and advised her to dress and take the children to the deck.</p>

<p>“I then returned to the upper deck and found that the crew
were lowering lifeboats containing women and children. When
Mrs. Carter and the children came up I had them placed in one
of the boats, which also contained Mrs. Astor, Mrs. Widener,
Mrs. Thayer and several other women.</p>

<h3>WATER POURING INTO THE SHIP.</h3>

<p>“I believed at the time that they would all return to the
steamer in a short time, feeling certain that there was no danger.
A few minutes later, however, I learned that water was pouring
into the ship and that she was in a serious condition. I saw Harry
Widener and walked to where he was standing on the port side
of the Titanic. An order had been given before the boats were
launched to put on lifebelts, and I had adjusted one around myself.</p>

<p>“I said to Mr. Widener, ‘Come on, Harry, let us go to the
starboard side and see if there is any chance to get in one of the
boats.’ He replied, ‘I think I’ll stick to the big ship, Billy, and
take a chance.’ I left him there and went to the starboard side
of A deck.</p>

<p>“There I saw Mr. Ismay and several officers filling the boats
with women. I aided them in the work, and as the last boat was
being filled we looked around for more women.</p>

<p>“The women that were in the boat were from the steerage
with their children. I guess there were about 40 of them. Mr.
Ismay and myself and several of the officers walked up and down<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_186">{186}</a></span>
the deck crying, ‘Are there any more women here?’ We called
for several minutes and got no answer.</p>

<p>“One of the officers then declared that if we wanted to we
could get into the boat if we took the place of seamen. He gave
us this preference because we were among the first-class passengers.</p>

<p>“Mr Ismay called again and after we got no reply we got
into the lifeboat. We took the oars and rowed with the two seamen.
We were about a mile away from the Titanic when she
went down. It seemed to me that it was less than a half hour.</p>

<p>“All the women were clad in thin clothes while I was in my
evening clothes, withtout a hat, and had on a pair of slippers.
The night was a dark one despite the fact that the stars were out.
I looked around just as the Titanic went down, being attracted by
the explosions. Mr. Ismay did not turn and look but instead was
very quiet, pulling on the oars.</p>

<h3>THE CARPATHIA SIGHTED.</h3>

<p>“I don’t know how long we were in the boat. It seemed to
be several hours before we sighted the Carpathia. One of the
women saw the steamer with her lights standing out in the darkness.
We then started toward her. All this time I was fearing
for my family, not knowing how they fared after leaving the Titanic
in the lifeboat.</p>

<p>“We reached the side of the Carpathia before dawn and were
taken aboard and given food and warmed. I do not know what
became of Mr. Ismay, for I saw my wife and children and hurried
toward them. I can tell you I was happy at that moment.</p>

<p>“On board the Carpathia we were taken care of excellently
and treated fine by the officers and passengers. As we were
among the first taken aboard we were given a little room. My
wife and little girl slept in the bunk, while I slept on the floor. It
was a terrible experience and one I never want to go through
again.</p>

<p>“It was my intention, if I could not get into one of the boats,
to leap from the hurricane deck and swim to one of the boats.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_187">{187}</a></span></p>

<p>“During the trip across I did not see any lifeboat drills, but
this may have been due to the fact that the members of the crew
were new to the boat and the fact that the officers thought her
perfectly safe. I believe that many more could have been saved
if there had been more boats.</p>

<p>“The men seemed to think that there was no immediate danger,
and I myself did not know whether to get into the boat with
Mr. Ismay or not until he said, ‘Come on, you might as well get
aboard.’</p>

<p>“I desire to correct what has been said about him. He was
perfectly cool and collected and aided a great deal in keeping the
women from the steerage quiet. I will probably be called before
the Senatorial investigating committee, and I can only say that
Mr. Ismay only left the boat after he saw there were no more
women on the deck.</p>

<p>“He called and so did I and we found none. I heard no shooting
while I was on the Titanic, but do not know what happened
after I left on the last boat.”</p>

<p>“Billy” Carter, his ten-year-old son, told of his experience
after he was awakened by his mother and dressed.</p>

<p>“Mamma woke me just after it happened,” he said “and papa
hurried to our rooms. While mamma and sister were dressing I
got dressed as quickly as I could. She told me to be a brave boy,
and we all went to the upper deck.</p>

<p>“All the women were on one side and the men on the other.
The officers held revolvers in their hands. We were placed in one
of the boats and rowed around for an awful long time until everybody
began to worry and think we would not be picked up.
Mamma helped to row our boat, and in the morning we sighted
the big ship Carpathia and were taken on board. I felt cold, but
we soon got warm and got something to eat. Then a short time
later papa came on board.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_188">{188}</a></span>”</p>

BOY’S DESPERATE FIGHT FOR LIFE.</h2>

Many Jump Overboard&mdash;Leaped Into Ocean&mdash;Eight
Year Old Boy’s Narrative&mdash;Was “Very Quiet After He Was
In Boat”&mdash;Another Lad Tells How He Saw His Uncle Die.</p></div>

<p>John B. Thayer, the seventeen-year-old son of Mrs. John B.
Thayer, gave a thrilling account of the sinking of the Titanic in
which his father lost his life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thayer was saved in one of the lifeboats, while her son
was rescued after a most exciting experience on an upturned
boat, upon which he clambered after struggling on the icy water
for some time.</p>

<p>According to Thayer’s account there was an explosion as
the Titanic sank, this explosion forcing him a considerable distance
and probably saving him from being drawn in by the suction
as the steamer went down. His statement follows:</p>

<p>“Father was in bed and mother and myself were about to
get into bed. There was no great shock. I was on my feet at
the time, and I do not think it was enough to throw anyone down.</p>

<p>“I put on an overcoat and rushed up on ‘A’ deck on the port
side. I saw nothing there. I then went forward to the bow to
see if I could see any signs of ice. The only ice I saw was on
the well deck.</p>

<p>“I could not see very far ahead, having just come out of a
brilliantly lighted room. I then went down to our room and my
father and mother came on deck with me, to the starboard side
of ‘A’ deck. We could not see anything there. Father thought
he saw small pieces of ice floating around, but I could not see
any myself. There was no big berg.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_189">{189}</a></span></p>

<p>“We walked around to the port side and the ship had then a
fair list to port. We stayed there looking over the side for about
five minutes. The list seemed very slowly to be increasing. We
then went down to our rooms on ‘C’ deck, all of us dressed quickly,
putting on all our clothes.</p>

<p>“We all put on life preservers, including the maid, and over
these we put our overcoats. Then we hurried up on deck and
walked around, looking out at different places until the women
were all ordered to collect on the port side. Father and I said
good-bye to mother at the top of the stairs on ‘A’ deck on the
port side and we went to the starboard side.</p>

<p>“As at this time we had no idea the boat would sink, we
walked around ‘A’ deck and then went to ‘B’ deck. Then we
thought we would go back to see if mother had gotten off safely,
and went to the port side of ‘A’ deck. We met the chief of the
main dining saloon and he told us that mother had not yet taken
a boat and he took us to her.</p>

<h3>FATHER LOST SIGHT OF FOREVER.</h3>

<p>“Father and mother went ahead and I followed. They went
down to ‘B’ deck, and a crowd got in front of me and I was not
able to catch them, and lost sight of them. As soon as I could get
through the crowd I tried to find them on ‘B’ deck, but without
success. That is the last time I saw my father.</p>

<p>“This was about one-half hour before she sank. I then went
to the starboard side, thinking that father and mother must have
gotten off in a boat. All of this time I was with a fellow named
Milton C. Long, of New York, whom I had just met that evening.</p>

<p>“On the starboard side the boats were getting away quickly.
Some boats were already off in a distance. We thought of getting
into one of the boats, the last boat to go on the forward
part of the starboard side, but there seemed to be such a crowd
around I thought it unwise to make any attempt to get into it.</p>

<p>“He and I stood by the davits of one of the boats that had
left. I did not notice anybody that I knew, except Mr. Lindley,
whom I had also just met that evening. I lost sight of him in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_190">{190}</a></span>
few minutes. Long and I then stood by the rail just a little aft
of the captain’s bridge.</p>

<p>“The list to the port had been growing greater all the time.
About this time the people began jumping from the stern.</p>

<p>“I thought of jumping myself, but was afraid of being
stunned on hitting the water. Three times I made up my mind to
jump out and slide down the davit ropes and try to make the
boats that were lying off from the ship, but each time Long got
hold of me and told me to wait a while.</p>

<p>“He then sat down and I stood up waiting to see what would
happen. Even then we thought she might possibly stay afloat.</p>

<p>“I got a sight on a rope between the davits and a star and
noticed that she was gradually sinking. About this time she
straightened up on an even keel and started to go down fairly
fast at an angle of about thirty degrees.</p>

<h3>SAYS GOOD-BYE TO EACH OTHER.</h3>

<p>“As she started to sink we left the davits and went back and
stood by the rail about even with the second funnel. Long and
myself said good-bye to each other and jumped up on the rail.
He put his legs over and held on a minute and asked me if I was
coming.</p>

<p>“I told him I would be with him in a minute. He did not
jump clear, but slid down the side of the ship. I never saw him
again.</p>

<p>“About five seconds after he jumped I jumped out, feet first.
I was clear of the ship, bent down, and as I came up I was pushed
away from the ship by some force. I came up facing the ship,
and one of the funnels seemed to be lifted off and fell towards
me, about 15 yards away, with a mass of sparks and steam coming
out of it.</p>

<p>“I saw the ship in a sort of a red glare, and it seemed to me
that she broke in two just in front of the third funnel. At this
time I was sucked down, and as I came up I was pushed out again
and twisted around by a large wave, coming up in the midst of
a great deal of small wreckage.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_191">{191}</a></span></p>

<p>“As I pushed it from around my head my hand touched the
cork fender of an overturned lifeboat. I looked up, saw some men
on the top and asked them to give me a hand. One of them, who
was a stoker, helped me up. In a short time the bottom was
covered with about 25 or 30 men.</p>

<p>“When I got on this I was facing the ship. The stern then
seemed to rise in the air and stopped at about an angle of 60
degrees. It seemed to hold there for a time and then, with
a hissing sound, it shot right down out of sight with people jumping
from the stern.</p>

<p>“The stern either pivoted around towards our boat or we
were sucked towards it, and as we only had one oar we could
not keep away. There did not seem to be very much suction and
most of us managed to stay on the bottom of our boat.</p>

<p>“We were then right in the midst of fairly large wreckage,
with people swimming all around us. The sea was very calm
and we kept the boat pretty steady, but every now and then a
wave would wash over it.</p>

<h3>SANG A HYMN AND SAID THE LORD’S PRAYER.</h3>

<p>“The assistant wireless operator was right next to me, holding
on to me and kneeling in the water. We all sang a hymn
and said the Lord’s prayer, and then waited for dawn to come.</p>

<p>“As often as we saw the other boats in a distance we would
yell ‘Ship ahoy!’ but they could not distinguish our cries from
any others so we all gave it up, thinking it useless. It was very
cold and none of us were able to move around to keep warm, the
water washing over her almost all the time.</p>

<p>“Towards dawn the wind sprang up roughing up the water
and making it difficult to keep the boat balanced. The wireless
man raised our hopes a great deal by telling us that the Carpathia
would be up in about three hours. About three thirty or
four o’clock some men on our boat on the bow sighted her mast
lights.</p>

<p>“I could not see them as I was sitting down with a man
kneeling on my leg. He finally got up and I stood up. We had<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_192">{192}</a></span>
the second officer, Mr. Lightholler, on board. We had an officer’s
whistle and whistled for the boats in the distance to come up
and take us off.</p>

<p>“It took about an hour and a half for the boats to draw near.
Two boats came up. The first took half and the other took the
balance, including myself.</p>

<p>“We had great difficulty about this time in balancing the
boat, as the men would lean too far, but were all taken aboard the
already crowded boat and in about a half or three-quarters of an
hour later we were picked up by the Carpathia.</p>

<p>“I have noticed second officer Lightholler’s statement that
‘J. B. Thayer was on our overturned boat,’ which would give the
impression that it was father, when he really meant it was I, as
he only learned my name in subsequent conversation on the Carpathia
and did not know I was ‘Junior.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>Little Arthur Olsen, eight years old, said that America was
a pretty good place, and that he was going to like it.</p>

<h3>TOOK CARE OF HIM IN THE LIFEBOAT.</h3>

<p>Arthur came to that conclusion because so many people had
been good to him. First there was Fritzjof Madsen, one of the
survivors, who took care of him in the lifeboat.</p>

<p>Then Miss Jean Campbell gave him hot coffee and sandwiches
and propped him comfortably against some clothing while
she busied herself with others.</p>

<p>Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt, Jr., next appeared with two
nice, big men, put him in a taxi with Miss Campbell and sent him
to a hot bath and bed at the Lisa Day Nursery, No. 458 West
Twentieth street, New York. And the next morning Miss Florence
Hayden taught him kindergarten songs and dances with her
class.</p>

<p>Later Arthur’s stepmother, Mrs. Esther Olson of No. 978
Hart street, Brooklyn, appeared and clasped him in her arms.
Her husband, Arthur’s father, Charlie Olsen, perished in the
wreck.</p>

<p>Mrs. Olsen had never seen Arthur, because after Charlie<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_193">{193}</a></span>
Oslen’s first wife died in Trondhjem, Norway, leaving the little
baby Arthur, he had come to America, where he married again.</p>

<p>A while ago Olsen crossed to see about the settlement of an
estate and to bring his son home. He and the boy were in the
steerage of the Titanic.</p>

<p>Arthur is a sturdy, quiet-faced little chap with red hair,
freckles and a ready smile. He speaks only Norwegian, but Mrs.
Olsen translated for him when he told his story.</p>

<p>“I was with papa on the boat,” said the youngster timidly,
“and then something was the matter. Papa said I should hurry
up and go into the boat and be a good boy. We had a friend,
Fritzjof Madsen, with us from our town, and he told me to go too.</p>

<p>“The ship was kind of shivering and everybody was running
around. We kept getting quite close down to the water, and the
water was quiet, like a lake.</p>

<h3>THE LAST BOY SAW OF PAPA.</h3>

<p>“Then I got into a boat and that was all I saw of papa. I
saw a lot of people floating around drowning or trying to snatch
at our boat. Then all of a sudden I saw Mr. Madsen swimming
next to the boat and he was pulled in. He took good care of me.</p>

<p>“In our boat everybody was crying and sighing. I kept very
quiet. One man got very crazy, then cried just like a little baby.
Another man jumped right into the sea and he was gone.</p>

<p>“It was awful cold in the boat, but I was dressed warm, like
we dress in Norway. I had to put on my clothes, when my papa
told me to on the big ship. I couldn’t talk to anybody, because
I don’t understand the language. Only Mr. Madsen talked
to me and told me not to be afraid, and I wasn’t afraid. Mr.
Madsen was shivering in his wet clothes, but he got all right after
the Carpathia came.”</p>

<p>A bright-faced boy of eight walked up and down in front of
Blake’s Star Hotel at No. 57 Clarkson street, New York, the day
after the Carpathia arrived. He was Marshall Drew of Greenport,
L. I., one of the survivors of the Titanic.</p>

<p>“It all seems just like the bad dreams that I used to have,” he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_194">{194}</a></span>
confided. “I never want to go to England again. I went over
there with my uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. James Drew, to Visit
my grandpa. We had a good time in England and started back
on the Titanic.</p>

<p>“The night of the wreck my aunt woke me and said she was
going to dress me and take me out on deck. I was sleepy and
didn’t want to get up. I could hear funny noises all over the ship
and sometimes a woman talking loud out in the corridor. My
aunt didn’t pay any attention to what I said but hurried me into
my clothes and rushed me with her up to the deck.</p>

<p>“There every one was running about. Some of the men
were laughing and saying there was no danger. They were taking
all the women and hurrying them into the boats along with
the children. We could not see what for. I thought at first that
we had got home.</p>

<h3>WAS HURRIED INTO A BOAT.</h3>

<p>“Aunt Lulu put me into the boat and then stood back with
Uncle James, and in a moment some one had hurried her into
the boat, too, and we went down the side, Uncle James waving
his hand at us and Aunt Lulu standing up and looking at him.</p>

<p>“Then the boat pulled away from the ship and there was a
lot of talk and screaming. We were a long time on the water and
were finally picked up by the Carpathia.”</p>

<p>Marshall and his aunt were saved. They were met at the
pier by his grandfather, Mr. Henry P. Christian, of Greenport,
and with his aunt were taken to the hotel along with other survivors
of the second cabin.</p>

<p>Miss Emily Rugg, 20 years old, of the Isle of Guernsey,
England, told a graphic story of the sinking.</p>

<p>Miss Rugg, who was one of the second class passengers, was
met in New York by her uncle, F. W. Queripel, a grocer. The
young woman was on her way to visit relatives.</p>

<p>She was asleep when the ship struck the berg, and the jar
aroused her. Looking out she saw a mass of ice. Throwing a
coat about her, she went on deck and saw lifeboats being lowered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_195">{195}</a></span></p>

<p>Returning to the cabin, she dressed, and then went to an adjoining
cabin and aroused two women friends.</p>

<p>Following this Miss Rugg ran up on deck and was taken in
charge by some of the crew, who dragged her toward a lifeboat.
She was lifted into the third from the last which left the ship.</p>

<p>She said that there seemed to be nearly seventy-five persons
in the boat and that it was very much crowded. In the meantime
a panic had started among those who remained on board
the Titanic.</p>

<p>An Italian jumped from the steerage deck and fell into a lifeboat,
landing upon a woman who had a baby in her arms.</p>

<p>Miss Rugg saw the Titanic go down and declares but for the
horror of it all, it might have been termed one of the grandest
sights she ever saw.</p>

<h3>SHIP TAKES ITS FINAL PLUNGE.</h3>

<p>The boat seemed to have broken in half, and with all the
lights burning brightly, the stern arose into the air, the lights being
extinguished as it did so. A moment later the ship plunged
beneath the surface.</p>

<p>Karl H. Behr, the well known tennis player, who went to
Australia in 1910 with the American team, was one of the Titanic
survivors.</p>

<p>He was graduated from Yale in 1906 and later from Columbia,
where he took a law degree. This is his statement of his experiences
on the night of the disaster.</p>

<p>“We were a party of four, Mr. and Mrs. R. L. Beckwith, Mrs.
Beckwith’s daughter, Miss Helen W. Newsom, and myself. Mr.
Beckwith and I had stayed up in the smoking room. We left
just before it closed for the night.</p>

<p>“I went to my stateroom and only partly undressed when I
felt a distinct jar run through the whole vessel, which quivered all
over. It was distinct enough for me to be certain that we had hit
something. I dressed again immediately, my first thought and
purpose being to reach my party at once.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_196">{196}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Mr. Behr told of assembling his party and added:</p>

<p>“I knew exactly where the lifeboats were, so Miss Newsom
and I and Mr. and Mrs. Beckwith went to the top deck. We waited
quietly while the first boat filled and was lowered. It appeared
to me to be quite full.</p>

<p>“We then went to the second boat, which was quite full. Mr.
Ismay was directing its launching. When Mrs. Beckwith came
to the edge of the lifeboat, which was hanging over the sides, she
asked Mr. Ismay before attempting to get in whether her men
could go with her, and I heard him reply quietly, ‘Why certainly,
madam.’ We then got into the boat.</p>

<p>“After we were in the boat we heard Mr. Ismay calling out
and asking if there were any more passengers to go in the boat.</p>

<h3>THE LAST PASSENGERS ON TOP DECK.</h3>

<p>“There were none, and we must have waited at least three
minutes or more before he ordered an officer into the boat and
two or three more of the crew who were alone on deck and under
perfect control. We were evidently the last passengers on the top
deck, as we could see no others.</p>

<p>“Most fortunately for us, when we left the ship everything
was handled in perfect discipline, Mr. Ismay launching our lifeboat
in a most splendid fashion, with absolute coolness, making
sure that all passengers were on board and that our crew was
complete. What happened later we know little about.</p>

<p>“As far as I am concerned I saw no signs of a panic and not
one person in our boat lost his head, nor do I know of a single
person being left behind on the top deck.”</p>

<p>George A. Harder, of No. 117 Eighth avenue, Brooklyn,
who with his bride was saved from the Titanic, told at his home
a graphic story of his experience.</p>

<p>“When the crash came my wife and I were in our stateroom,
about to retire,” said Harder. “Suddenly there came what seemed
like a low, long groan at the ship’s bottom. It did not sound
like a collision.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_197">{197}</a></span></p>

<p>“Taking my wife by the arm, I rushed to the deck. Passengers
were already swarming there, asking what had happened.</p>

<p>“I heard an officer order a carpenter below to ascertain the
damage. He never returned. That the officers already knew the
ship was likely to founder was evident from the fact that one lifeboat
containing among others Karl M. Behr, the Brooklyn tennis
player, had been launched. Persons on our side of the boat&mdash;the
starboard side&mdash;were climbing into a second boat.</p>

<p>“It was a bitter cold night. The stars were bright and their
rays were reflected in the surrounding sea, which was as smooth
as glass. Farther and farther we drifted away in the lifeboat,
leaving behind us the doomed ship.</p>

<h3>BLOWN TO SAFETY BY EXPLOSION.</h3>

<p>“Suddenly there sounded from the Titanic the strains of
‘The Star-Spangled Banner.’ As I glanced back at the mighty
vessel in the glare of her lights I saw Col. Archibald Gracie clinging
to a brass rail near one of the forward funnels. I afterward
learned the explosion of the boilers blew him out of the vortex of
the sucked in water to calmer water, where he was rescued.</p>

<p>“Gradually the distance between the Titanic and our lifeboat
increased. Her lights continued to gleam, her band to play. Two
hours later, as she loomed a dark mass on the horizon, her lights
suddenly went out. Then across the water, mingling with the
strains of ‘Nearer, My God, to Thee,’ came the distressing cries
of those about to die.</p>

<p>“Out of the jumble of foreign tongues could be distinguished
the shrieks of steerage women who were grouped at the aft
end of the boat. And above all the sounds, like a benediction,
sounded that hymn. It was nameless anguish to us to sit in that
open boat and realize our helplessness to aid those about to die.
We forgot our own losses, our own sufferings. Only a few of
us dared to look at the mighty ship as, bow first, she plunged
beneath the surface.”</p>

<p>Harder denied that many passengers were shot. He said<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_198">{198}</a></span>
he knows three Italians were killed, but by whom he does not
know.</p>

<p>Police Magistrate Robert C. Cornell, whose wife and her two
sisters, Mrs. Edward Appleton and Mrs. John Murray Brown, of
Denver, were among those rescued from the Titanic, told her
story.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cornell,” said the Magistrate, “is of the same opinion
as many others of the survivors, that many of the lifeboats left
the side of the Titanic before they had nearly their capacity.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cornell, with Mrs. Appleton, was assigned a place in the
second boat. This boat when it was lowered contained twenty-three
persons and she says there was room for at least seventeen
more without overcrowding. In fact, all of the boats, my wife
says, could have carried many more passengers with safety.</p>

<p>“There were three oars in the boat in which my wife and
Mrs. Appleton were put, and no food or water or covering of
any sort to keep out the cold. The crew of this boat consisted of
one sailor and one petty officer.</p>

<p>“When the boat was lowered an Italian was seen struggling
in the water and he was picked up. The three men then each
took an oar and did the best they could.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cornell and her sister, who have a slight knowledge
of rowing, took turns at the oars, as did the other women in the
boat, and after drifting about in the sea for about four hours were
picked up by the Carpathia.</p>

<p>“Miss Edith Evans, a niece of Mrs. Cornell and her sisters
were traveling with them, and she and Mrs. Brown were assigned
to places in one of the boats which left after the one in which
Mrs. Cornell and Mrs. Appleton were placed.</p>

<p>“When this boat was about to be lowered it was found that
it contained one more passenger than it could carry. Then the
question came as to who should leave.</p>

<p>“Miss Evans, a handsome girl of twenty-five, said to Mrs.
Brown that she had children at home and should be the one to
remain. Miss Evans left the boat saying she would take a chance
of getting in a boat later.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_199">{199}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br><br>
CARPATHIA TO THE RESCUE.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">Cunarder’s Race to Titanic’s Aid&mdash;Captain Rostrom’s Unvarnished
but Dramatic Report&mdash;Knot in Operator’s Shoelace
Saved Hundreds of Lives&mdash;Was About to Retire, but Slight
Delay Enabled Him to Hear Message&mdash;Icebergs Defied in
Desperate Rush.</p></div>

<p>Before the Carpathia sailed once again on her sadly interrupted
voyage to the Mediterranean, Captain A. H. Rostrom
made public the report he has sent to the Cunard Company telling
an unvarnished tale of the rescue of the Titanic survivors.
The report written on the regular stationery of the Carpathia,
reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
R. M. S. Carpathia,<br>
April 19, 1912.<br>
</p>

<p class="nind">
General Manager Cunard Steamship Company, Ltd., Liverpool.<br>
</p>

<p>Sir: I beg to report that at 12.34 A. M. on the 15th inst. I
was informed of urgent distress message from Titanic, with her
position. I immediately ordered ship turned around and put in
course for that position; we being then fifty-eight miles S. 42 E.
(T) from her. Had heads of all departments called and issued
what I considered the necessary orders to be in preparation for
any emergency.</p>

<p>At 2.40 A. M., saw flare half a point on port bow, taking this
for granted to be ship. Shortly after we sighted our first iceberg
(I had previously had lookouts doubled, knowing that Titanic
had struck ice, and so took every care and precaution).</p>

<p>We soon found ourselves in a field of bergs, large and small,
and had to alter course several times to clear bergs; weather fine<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_200">{200}</a></span>
clear, light airs, calm sea, beautifully clear night, though
dark.</p>

<p>We stopped at 4 A. M., thus doing distance in three hours
and a half, picking up the first boat at 4.10 A. M.; boat in charge
of an officer and he reported to me that Titanic had foundered.</p>

<p>At 8.30 A. M. last boat picked up. All survivors aboard and
all boats accounted for, viz fifteen lifeboats alongside, one lifeboat
abandoned, two Berthon boats alongside (saw one bottom
upward among wreckage) and according to second officer not
been launched, it having got jammed, making sixteen lifeboats
and four Berthon boats accounted for.</p>

<p>By the time we had cleared first boat it was breaking day,
and we could distinguish the other boats all within an area of
four miles. We also saw that we were surrounded by icebergs,
large and small, and three miles to the N. W. of us a huge field
of drift ice with large and small bergs in it, the ice field trending
from N. W. round by W. and S. to S. E., as far as we could see
either way.</p>

<h3>PROMPT IN RESCUE WORK.</h3>

<p>At 8 A. M. the Leyland S. S. California came up. I gave him
the principal news and asked him to search and I would proceed
to New York; at 8.50 proceeded full speed. While searching over
vicinity of disaster and while we were getting people aboard I
gave orders to get Spare hands along and swing in all our boats,
disconnect the falls and hoist us as many Titanic boats as possible
in our davits; also, get some on fo’castle deck by derricks.
We got thirteen lifeboats, six on forward deck and seven in
davits.</p>

<p>After getting all survivors aboard and while searching I got
a clergyman to offer a short prayer of thankfulness for those saved
and also a short burial service for those lost.</p>

<p>Before deciding definitely where to make for I conferred
with Mr. Ismay, and though he told me to do what I thought best
I informed him, taking everything into consideration, I considered
New York best.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_201">{201}</a></span></p>

<p>I knew we should require more provisions, clean linen, blankets
and so forth, even if we went to the Azores.</p>

<p>As most of the passengers saved were women and children,
and they were very hysterical, and not knowing what medical attention
they might require, thought it best to go to New York;
also thought it would be better for Mr. Ismay to get to New York
or England as soon as possible and knowing that I should be out
of wireless communication with anything very soon if I proceeded
to the Azores.</p>

<p>Again, passengers were all hysterical about ice, and pointed
out to Mr. Ismay the possibility of seeing ice if we went to Halifax.
Then I knew from the gravity of the disaster that it would
be desirable to keep in touch with land stations all we could.</p>

<h3>THE MAJORITY OF THE WOMEN LOSE THEIR HUSBANDS.</h3>

<p>I am pleased to say that all survivors have been very plucky.
The majority of the women, first, second and third classes lost
their husbands, and considering all have been wonderfully well.
Tuesday our doctor reported all survivors physically well.</p>

<p>Our first class passengers have behaved splendidly, giving
up the cabins quite voluntarily and supplying the ladies
with clothes and so forth. We all turned out of our cabins to give
them up to survivors, saloons, smokerooms, library and so forth
also being used for sleeping accommodations. Our crew also
turned out to let the crew of the Titanic take their quarters.</p>

<p>I am pleased to state that owing to preparations made for
the comfort of the survivors none are the worse for exposure and
so forth.</p>

<p>I beg to specially mention how willingly and cheerfully the
whole of the ship’s company have behaved throughout, receiving
the highest praise from everybody, and I can assure you, that I
am very proud to have such a ship’s company under my command.</p>

<p>We have experienced very great difficulty in transmitting
news, also names of survivors. Our wireless is very poor, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_202">{202}</a></span>
again, we have had so many interruptions from other ships, and
also messages from shore (principally press, which we ignored).
I gave instructions to send first all official messages, then names
of passengers, then survivors’ private messages, and the last press
messages, as I considered the three first items most important
and necessary.</p>

<p>We had haze early Tuesday morning for several hours;
again more or less all Wednesday from 5.30 A. M. to 5 P. M.
Strong south-southwesterly winds and clear weather Tuesday
with moderate rough sea.</p>

<p>Bearing the survivors of the ill-fated Titanic and with them
the first detailed news of the most terrible catastrophe of the
sea, the steamship Carpathia, vessel of woe, bore up through the
narrows of the harbor of New York, and tied up at the Cunard
pier whence it had sailed less than a week before.</p></div>

<h3>LIKE A FUNERAL SHIP.</h3>

<p>Silently as a funeral ship the Carpathia sped. Passengers
and crew lined the upper decks. From portholes peered the
faces of scores.</p>

<p>But no cheer such as usually comes at the end of a cruise
was heard. The lights shone brilliantly from every port and
from the upper decks, but the big vessel moved silently, almost
spectral in its appearance.</p>

<p>There was all the speed at the vessel’s command in its approach.
Moving in from the open sea, the liner turned its prow
up the channel toward the spot where the reflection in the sky
showed the presence of the great city.</p>

<p>At full speed she bore northward between the twinkling
lights on shore. There were sick on board and their condition
did not permit of delay.</p>

<p>To the dismal souls on board, the weather must have seemed
peculiarly fitting.</p>

<p>All day the vessel had raced before a half a gale which beat
fiercely against her prow as her course was changing northward.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_203">{203}</a></span>
The rain fell heavily and was blown in gusts that defied protecting
shelter.</p>

<p>Spray flew from the waves and was thrown in showers as
high as the top of the huge bulwarks.</p>

<p>Such good headway had the Carpathia made, that she docked
fully two hours before it had been expected. All day heavy
fog had hung over the lower bay and it was reported that the
weather was heavy and thick outside.</p>

<p>Officers of the Cunard and White Star Lines, from their offices
on Lower Broadway, informed the anxious hundreds who
appealed for information that the boat would not be in until
probably one or two o’clock in the morning. Tug skippers, shipping
men and the weather-wise made wagers among themselves,
over the time the Carpathia would arrive. There were many
who predicted confidently that the sorrow-laden liner would not
be able to come up the channel before the dawn.</p>

<h3>CARPATHIA’S WELCOME RETURN.</h3>

<p>At 6 o’clock in the morning the wireless flashed to the shore
that the Carpathia was abreast of the Nantucket light ship.
This is 187 miles from Ambrose Light, at the entrance to the
Channel. The Carpathia is rated as a thirteen knot boat, and
it was not believed port would be reached until at least 11 o’clock
at night.</p>

<p>But a favorable wind beat upon the ship that was bringing
home the grief-stricken women who had sailed so joyously on
the Titanic. The gale that beat the waves, also hurried the ship
on the last leg to port. It seemed that Captain Rostrom, in command,
anticipating possibly that fog might make dangerous a
trip up the channel in the night, had wished to avoid the scores
of tugs that he knew would be sent to meet him.</p>

<p>In consequence, the first word that came from Fire Island
Light was vague and uncertain. They knew only that a great
vessel, lighted from stem to stern, was approaching the harbor,
but whether it was the Carpathia, the Mauretania or some other
liner, could not be ascertained.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_204">{204}</a></span></p>

<p>But when the vessel came opposite Ambrose Light, there
was no longer any doubt. From Sandy Hook to Quarantine and
to all the stations up the channel the word was flashed that the
Carpathia was coming. From the Battery to the Bronx the
news spread and sent thousands hurrying toward the great Cunard
docks.</p>

<p>Then the tugs began snorting and steaming as they pushed
the large hulk around in midstream. Slowly she yielded until
headed straight toward the slip.</p>

<p>The slow process was accomplished while a dozen other
tugs pressed their noses against the sides, and those on board
tried vainly to get some connected descriptions of the great catastrophe
that stunned the peoples of two continents.</p>

<p>Their efforts were largely futile. The passengers were too
far away for their voices to carry well. The crew, acting under
instructions, which, rightly or wrongly, have been credited by
persons here to the desires of J. Bruce Ismay, the White Star
Line chief, who escaped in one of the boats from the Titanic, refused
to give any information they may have procured.</p>

<p>While the ship was being docked, the photographers on the
tugs were active. Flash after flash shot across the water as the
camera men took their pictures.</p>

<p>Finally the Carpathia was fast at her dock, and the gangways
were lowered to let the sorrow-laden survivors ashore to
receive the welcome that awaited them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_205">{205}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br><br>
REFUSED TO LEAVE HUSBAND.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">“Where You Are I Shall Be,” Said Mrs. Isidor Straus&mdash;He Begged
Her in Vain to Enter the Waiting Lifeboat&mdash;Women Row Lifeboats&mdash;Stokers
no Oarsmen&mdash;Crazed Men Rescued&mdash;Collapsible
Boats Failed to Work.</p></div>

<p>The story of how Mrs. Isidor Straus, wife of the New York
merchant, met death with her husband on the Titanic rather than be
separated from him, was rendered complete when Miss Ellen Bird,
maid to Mrs. Straus, told how the self-sacrifice of Mrs. Straus made
it possible for her to escape a watery grave.</p>

<p>Miss Bird also supplied details of the appealing scenes between
Mrs. Straus and her husband when the elderly though heroic woman
brushed aside three opportunities to be saved, declaring to solicitous
passengers that death in her husband’s arms was more to be
desired than life without him.</p>

<p>Miss Bird’s narrative was repeated by Sylvester Byrnes, general
manager of R. H. Macy &amp; Co. He said:</p>

<p>“When the Titanic struck the iceberg Mr. and Mrs. Straus
were walking arm in arm on the upperdeck. Although assured by
the officers that there was no immediate cause for alarm, Mrs.
Straus, with her husband, hurried to the stateroom of her maid, cautioning
Miss Bird to dress hurriedly and as comfortably as she could,
because the passengers might have to take to the lifeboats. Then Mr.
and Mrs. Straus returned to the deck, where, shortly after, they were
joined by Miss Bird.</p>

<p>“Mr. Straus stepped aside when the first boat was being filled,
explaining that he could not go until all the women and children had
been given places. ‘Where you are, Papa, I shall be,’ spoke up Mrs.
Straus, rejecting all entreaties to enter the boat.</p>

<p>“Mr. Straus vainly attempted to persuade his wife to enter the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_206">{206}</a></span>
second boat, assuring her that eventually he would find a place after
all the women and children had been taken off.</p>

<p>“Miss Bird, who was making her first trip across, having been
engaged in London by Mrs. Straus, joined other passengers in
urging Mrs. Straus to enter the boat, but she clung closer to her husband
and repeated previous declarations that unless Mr. Straus accompanied
her she would remain behind. Mr. Straus only shook his
head.</p>

<p>“One after another the boats were lowered. Finally that in
which Mrs. John Jacob Astor was rescued was made ready. ‘Here
is a place for you, Mrs. Straus!’ cried Mrs. Astor. Mrs. Straus only
shrank closer to her husband.</p>

<p>“Several passengers, at least two of them being women, attempted
to force Mrs. Straus into the boat, but she cried out against
separation from her husband and ordered her maid, Miss Bird, to
take the place beside Mrs. Astor.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>You go,’ said Mrs. Straus to the maid. ‘I must stay with my
husband.’</p>

<h3>CLASPED IN EACH OTHERS ARMS.</h3>

<p>“Seeing it was useless to argue with Mrs. Straus, several men
passengers lifted Miss Bird into the boat, which was lowered with all
haste. As this boat and two others, comprising the last to leave the
vessel, glided across the waters into the black night the last glimpse
caught of Mr. and Mrs. Straus showed them standing on the deck,
clasped in each other’s arms, weeping.”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. C. E. Henry Stengel, of Newark, N. J., received
the congratulations of friends on their rescue in their home at Broad
street and Lincoln Park.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Stengel left the Titanic in different boats. Mr.
Stengel first saw his wife safely aboard one boat, then assisted other
women to leave. As a small boat, half full, was being lowered, Mr.
Stengel says he asked the officer in charge if he should come aboard.</p>

<p>“He replied, ‘Sure, come on in,’ said Mr. Stengel.</p>

<p>“I jumped and was rolled along the bottom of the boat. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_207">{207}</a></span>
man in charge said, ‘That’s the funniest drop I have seen in a long
while.’</p>

<p>“Every one in the boat was laughing. There was no real
thought of danger among the passengers, and we all expected to return
to the steamer within a few hours.</p>

<p>“In our boat was Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff-Gordon, Miss Francatolla,
A. L. Solomon, three stokers and two sailors. We tried to
keep near the other boats, but, finding it hard to do so, tied three of
the boats together.</p>

<p>An officer on one of the boats had provided himself with some
blue fire, and so when the Carpathia arrived at the scene we were the
second or third boat to be picked up.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell the time of events. For a long time after we left
the Titanic her lights were all burning, and we were trying to keep
as close as possible to her. She settled so slowly that I did not notice
anything unusual, until suddenly all the lights of the steamer
went out.</p>

<h3>CAPTAIN KEEPS EVERY BODY IN GOOD SPIRITS.</h3>

<p>“Then I realized that every one was in danger. I saw the captain
twice after the collision with the iceberg. His face showed great
anxiety, but his words were so reassuring that every one kept in good
spirits.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Stengel said:</p>

<p>“When the shock came I was retiring. At first I was not going
to leave the stateroom, but we heard some loud talking, and Mr.
Stengel urged me to go. I put on a coat and tied a veil over my
head. He put on his trousers and wore a coat. As we reached the
deck a loud order was given of ‘Women and children into the lifeboats!’
There did not appear to be any danger, but my husband insisted
I should get into one of the boats. He walked away and I
could see him assisting other women into boats.</p>

<p>“Suddenly our boat was lowered. I could still see my husband,
and waved my veil, and he waved a handkerchief. Our boat was
crowded with women. There were three stokers and one officer.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_208">{208}</a></span>
The stokers knew nothing about the use of oars, and we women took
the oars.</p>

<p>“We stayed close by another boat in which three Chinamen had
been found lying face down at the bottom of the boat. They could
not be made to do anything. There was little alarm. The band was
playing on the steamer and most every one wished to get back.</p>

<p>“Suddenly the lights on the steamer went out, and then we realized
what had happened. At first several of the boats kept together,
as there was something in the distance that appeared to be a light.
We all tried to get to the light, but after an hour or so found that it
was simply some light reflection from the tip of an iceberg.</p>

<p>“Just before leaving the steamer I saw Col. Astor. He was
with his wife, and was insisting that she get into a lifeboat that was
being filled. She seemed to resist, and Mr. Astor picked her up and
put her in a seat. He was smiling all the time. There was some
difficulty in the next boat, and Col. Astor was laughing as he helped
several women into the boat.</p>

<h3>ALL THE MEN ACTED CALMLY AND CHEERFULLY.</h3>

<p>“All the men among the passengers, so far as I could see, acted
calmly, cheerfully, masterfully. Among the stokers and others who
were sent to man the lifeboats there were many cowards.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Emily Richards, who with her mother and her two children
was on the Titanic, journeying from Penzance, Cornwall, to
join her husband in Akron, O., said:</p>

<p>“I had put the children in bed and had gone to bed myself. We
had been making good time all day, the ship rushing through the
sea at a tremendous rate, and the air on deck was cold and crisp. I
didn’t hear the collision, for I was asleep. But my mother came and
shook me.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>There is surely danger,’ said mamma. ‘Something has gone
wrong.’</p>

<p>“So we put on our slippers and outside coats and got the children
into theirs and went on deck. We had on our night gowns
under our coats. As we went up the stairway some one was shout<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_209">{209}</a></span>ing
down in a calm voice: ‘Everybody put on their life preservers
before coming on deck!’</p>

<p>“We went back and put them on, assuring each other that it
was nothing. When we got on deck we were told to pass through
the dining room to a ladder that was placed against the side of the
cabins and led to the upper deck.</p>

<p>“We were put through the portholes into the boats, and the boat
I was in had a foot of water in it. As soon as we were in we were
told to sit down on the bottom. In that position we were so low that
we could not see out over the gunwale.</p>

<p>“Once the boat had started away some of the women stood up,
and the seamen, with their hands full with the oars, simply put their
feet on them and forced them back into the sitting position.</p>

<p>“We had not got far away by the time the ship went down, and
after that there were men floating in the water all around, and seven
of them were picked up by us in the hours that followed between that
and daybreak.</p>

<h3>MAD WITH EXPOSURE.</h3>

<p>“Some of these seven were already mad with exposure, and
babbled gibberish, and kept trying to get up and overturn the boat.
The other men had to sit upon them to hold them down.</p>

<p>“Two of the men picked up were so overcome with the cold of
the water that they died before we reached the Carpathia, and their
dead bodies were taken aboard. One woman, who spoke a tongue
none of us could understand, was picked up by the boat and believed
that her children were lost.</p>

<p>“She was entirely mad. When her children were brought to her
on the Carpathia she was wild with joy, and lay down on the children
on the floor, trying to cover them with her body, like a wild beast
protecting its young, and they had to take her children away from
her for the time to save them from being suffocated.”</p>

<p>Miss Caroline Bonnell, of Youngstown, O., one of the survivors,
said that passengers who got into lifeboats were led to believe
that a steamship was near and that the lives of all would be saved.</p>

<p>Miss Bonnell and her aunt, Miss Lily Bonnell, of London, Eng<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_210">{210}</a></span>land,
were traveling with George D. Wick, an iron and steel manufacturer
of Youngstown, his wife and daughter, Mary Natalie Wick.
The women were saved. Mr. Wick went down with the ship. Like
hundreds of others, he stood aside to give the women and children
first chance.</p>

<p>“Miss Wick and I occupied a stateroom together,” said Miss
Bonnell. “We were awakened shortly before midnight by a sudden
shock, a grinding concussion. Miss Wick arose and looked out of
the stateroom window. She saw some men playfully throwing particles
of ice at one another, and realized that we had struck an iceberg.</p>

<p>“She and I dressed, not hastily, for we were not greatly
alarmed, and went on deck.</p>

<p>“There we found a number of passengers. Naturally they were
all somewhat nervous, but there was nothing approaching a panic.
The other members of our party also had come on deck, and we
formed a little group by ourselves.</p>

<h3>HAD NO IDEA THE SHIP WAS SINKING.</h3>

<p>“We were told to put on life belts, and obeyed. Then the sailors
began to launch the lifeboats. Still we were not alarmed. We had
no doubt that all on board would be saved. In fact, we had no idea
that the ship was sinking and believed that the resort to the lifeboats
was merely a precaution.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wick kissed his wife good-by, and our boat, the first on
that side of the ship, was lowered to the sea. There were about
twenty-five women in the boat, with two sailors and a steward to
row. These were the only men. The boat would have held many
more.</p>

<p>“As the boat was being loaded the officer in charge pointed out
a light that glowed dimly in the distance on the surface of the sea
and directed our sailors to row to that, land their passengers and return
to the Titanic for more.</p>

<p>“As we were rowed away we saw that the great liner was settling.
We kept our boat pointed toward the light to which we were
to row. As a matter of fact, there were two lights&mdash;one red and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_211">{211}</a></span>
the other white. Sailormen on the Carpathia told us subsequently
that the lights might have been those of a fishing boat caught in the
ice and drifting with it&mdash;but who can tell?</p>

<p>“After a while our sailors ceased rowing, saying it was of no
use to keep on. Then we women tried to row, with the double light
our objective. We rowed and rowed, but did not seem to gain on
the light, which, like a will-o’-the-wisp, seemed ever to evade us.
Finally we gave up and sat huddled in the lifeboat.</p>

<p>“Some of the women complained of the cold, but the members
of our own party did not suffer, being provided with plenty of wraps.</p>

<p>“From the distance of a mile or more we heard the explosion
and saw the Titanic go down. The lights did not go out all at once.
As the ship slowly settled the rows of lights, one after another,
winked out, disappearing beneath the surface. Finally the ship
plunged down, bow first, and the stern slipped beneath the waves.</p>

<h3>HAD HOPED ALL ON BOARD WOULD BE SAVED.</h3>

<p>“Even then we had hoped that all on board might be saved. It
was only after we had been taken aboard the Carpathia, and somehow
few of us there were compared with the great company aboard
the Titanic, that we got the first glimmer of the appalling reality.”</p>

<p>“I never dreamed that it was serious,” said Alfred White, one
of the two oilers from the engine room who were saved by being
picked up.</p>

<p>“I was on the whale deck in the bow calling the watch that was
to relieve me when the ice first came aboard. It was a black berg
that we struck&mdash;that is, it was composed of black ice. It could not
be seen at all at night.</p>

<p>“The striking opened seams below the water line, but did not
even scratch the paint above the line. I know that because I was
one of those who helped make an examination over the side with a
lantern.</p>

<p>“I went down into the light engine room, where my station was,
at 12.40 o’clock. We even made coffee, showing that there wasn’t
much thought of danger. An hour later I was still working around<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_212">{212}</a></span>
the light engines. I heard the chief engineer tell one of his subordinates
that No. 6 bulkhead had given away.</p>

<p>“At that time things began to look bad, for the Titanic was far
down by the bow. I was told to go up and see how things were going,
and made my way up through the dummy funnel to the bridge
deck.</p>

<p>“By that time all the boats had left the ship and yet every one
in the engine room was at his post. I was near the captain and heard
him say: ‘Well, boys, I guess it’s every man for himself now.’</p>

<p>“I slipped down some loose boat falls and dropped into the water.
There was a boat not far away, which later picked me up.
There were five firemen in her as a crew, forty-nine women and sixteen
children. There was no officer.</p>

<h3>“THE MILLIONAIRES BOAT.”</h3>

<p>“During the six hours we were afloat we were near what we
boys later called the millionaries’ boat. That lifeboat had only sixteen
passengers in her. When all were put aboard the Carpathia the
six men who were the crew of that millionaires’ boat each got £5.
Those who had worked harder saving second-class passengers didn’t
get a cent.”</p>

<p>White then told of the way in which the children from the open
boats were swung aboard the Carpathia in sacks, while the women
were hoisted up in rope swings.</p>

<p>“Near the boat in which I was,” White went on, “were two
collapsible boats which had failed to work and were not better than
rafts. They had thirty-two men clinging to them who were later
picked up by the lifeboats.</p>

<p>“The other two collapsible boats which had about sixty persons
in them deposited what women they carried in the regular lifeboats
and went to the scene of the sinking.</p>

<p>“From the water were picked up perhaps fifty of the crew who
had floated off when she sank or else who had jumped before. The
second officer was picked up, too, and took command of a boat.</p>

<p>“Now, about the sinking itself. There was some sort of an explosion
just about 2 o’clock, or shortly after I had gone overboard.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_213">{213}</a></span>
It was not until this explosion, the nature of which I do not know,
that the lights went out. They had been fed by steam from oil
boilers.</p>

<p>“The explosion caused a break in the ship just aft of the third
funnel. The forward section went down bow first. The after part
then seemed almost to right itself, and we thought she might keep
afloat.</p>

<p>“But it wasn’t long before the propellers shot out of the water,
and down she went. A steward who stood on the poop deck had
the ship go down under him. He was picked up later, and his watch
was found to have stopped at 2.20 A. M., so we knew that that was
the time she foundered. There was no apparent suction when she
foundered.</p>

<h3>CONTINUALLY BUMPED INTO DEAD BODIES.</h3>

<p>While we were cruising about the place our oars continually
bumped into dead bodies, wearing life belts. Some of the bodies
were of the half-naked stokers. They were killed by the shock. We
knew that the temperature of the water had been 28 degrees at 11
o’clock the same evening. While we were waiting for the boat to
go down we heard some fifteen or twenty shots from the rail of the
ship. We only surmised what they were.”</p>

<p>There was a fireman who told of a woman in the boat which
he helped man who started up “Pull for the Shore” and “Nearer My
God, to Thee” after his boat had left the wreck. This kept up all
night until the Carpathia arrived.</p>

<p>Laurence Beasley, a Cambridge University man, who was a second-cabin
passenger on the Titanic, amplified his previous account
while visiting the White Star offices. After describing events immediately
following the collision with the iceberg and his departure in a
lifeboat, Mr. Beasley is quoted as saying:</p>

<p>“We drifted away easily as the oars were got out, and headed
directly away from the ship. Our crew seemed to be mostly cooks in
white jackets, two at an oar, with a stoker at the tiller, who had been
elected captain. He told us he had been at sea twenty-six years and
had never yet seen such a calm night on the Atlantic.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_214">{214}</a></span></p>

<p>“As we rowed away from the Titanic we looked back from time
to time to watch her, and a more striking spectacle it was not possible
for any one to see. In the distance she looked an enormous
length, her great bulk outlined in black against the starry sky, every
porthole and saloon blazing with light. It was impossible to think
anything could be wrong with such a leviathan, were it not for that
ominous tilt downward in the bows where the water was by now up
to the lowest row of portholes.</p>

<h3>SHIP’S END ONLY A QUESTION OF MINUTES.</h3>

<p>“About 2 A. M., as near as I can remember, we observed her
settling very rapidly, with the bows and the bridge completely under
water, and concluded it was now only a question of minutes before
she went, and so it proved. She slowly tilted straight on end, with
the stern vertically upward, and, as she did, the light in the cabins
and saloons, which had not flickered for a moment since we left,
died out, came on again for a single flash, and finally went out altogether.
At the same time the machinery roared down through the
vessel with a rattle and a groaning that could be heard for miles, the
weirdest sound, surely, that could be heard in the middle of the ocean
a thousand miles away from land.</p>

<p>“But this was not quite the end. To our amazement, she remained
in that upright position for a time which I estimate at five
minutes; others in the boat say less, but it was certainly some minutes
while we watched at least one hundred and fifty feet of the
Titanic towering up above the level of the sea and looming black
against the sky.</p>

<p>“Then, with a quiet, slanting dive, she disappeared beneath the
waters. And there was left to us the gently heaving sea, the boat
filled to standing room with men and women in every conceivable
condition of dress and undress; above, the perfect sky of brilliant
stars, with not a cloud in the sky, all tempered with a bitter cold that
made us all long to be one of the crew who toiled away with the oars
and kept themselves warm thereby&mdash;a curious, deadening, bitter cold
unlike anything we had felt before.</p>

<p>“And then, with all these, there fell on the ear the most appall<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_215">{215}</a></span>ing
noise that ever human ear listened to&mdash;the cries of hundreds of
our fellow-beings struggling in the icy-cold water, crying for help
with a cry that we knew could not be answered. We longed to return
and pick up some of those swimming, but this would have meant
swamping our boat and further loss of the lives of all of us. We
tried to sing to keep the women from hearing the cries, and rowed
hard to get away from the scene of the wreck.</p>

<p>“We kept a lookout for lights, and several times it was shouted
that steamers’ lights were seen. Presently, low down on the horizon,
we saw a light that slowly resolved itself into a double light, and
we watched eagerly to see if the two would separate and so prove
to be only two of our boats. To our joy they moved as one, and
round we swung the boat and headed for her.</p>

<p>“The steersman shouted: ‘Now, boys, sing!’ and for the first
time the boat broke into song, ‘Row for the Shore, Sailors,’ and for
the first time tears came to the eyes of us all as we realized that
safety was at hand. Our rescuer showed up rapidly, and as she
swung around we saw her cabins all alight, and knew she must be a
large steamship. She was now motionless and we had to row to her.
Just then day broke&mdash;a beautiful, quiet dawn. We were received
with a welcome that was overwhelming in its warmth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_216">{216}</a></span>”</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br><br>
LADY DUFF-GORDON’S EXPERIENCES.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">Says it was as if Giant Hand had Pushed Ship Down&mdash;Realistic Picture
of Titanic’s Death Plunge&mdash;The Long, Dreary Wait&mdash;Man
at Wheel Tells of Crash&mdash;Told by Phone “Iceberg Ahead”
Just as Ship Struck&mdash;Saw Captain on Bridge.</p></div>

<p>Almost frenzied by the memory of the disaster through which
they had passed many of the survivors were unable for days even
to discuss all the details of the Titanic horror.</p>

<p>One of the best accounts was given by Lady Duff-Gordon, wife
of Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, who dictated it. Her tale shows that
the Titanic was near icebergs before she went to bed on the night of
the disaster.</p>

<p>Here is her story, as well as that of others:</p>

<p>“I was asleep. The night was perfectly clear. We had watched
for some time the fields of ice. There was one just before I went
below to retire. I noticed among the fields of ice a number of large
bergs.</p>

<p>“There was one which one of the officers pointed out to me. He
said that it must have been 100 feet high and seemed to be miles long.
It was away off in the distance. I went to my bedroom and retired.</p>

<p>“I was awakened by a long grinding sort of shock. It was not
a tremendous crash, but more as though some one had drawn a giant
finger all along the side of the boat.</p>

<p>“I awakened my husband and told him that I thought we had
struck something. There was no excitement that I could hear, but
my husband went up on deck. He returned and told me that we had
hit some ice, apparently a big berg, but that there seemed to be no
danger. We went on deck.</p>

<p>“No one, apparently, thought there was any danger. We
watched a number of women and children and some men going into<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_217">{217}</a></span>
the lifeboats. At last one of the officers came to me and said, ‘Lady
Gordon, you had better go in one of the boats.’</p>

<p>“I said to my husband: ‘Well, we might as well take the boat,
although I think it will be only a little pleasure excursion until morning.’</p>

<p>“The boat was the twelfth or thirteenth to be launched. It was
the captain’s special boat. There was still no excitement. Five
stokers got in and two Americans&mdash;A. L. Solomon, of New York,
and L. Stengel, of Newark. Besides these there were two of the
crew, Sir Cosmo, myself and a Miss Frank, an English girl.</p>

<p>“There were a number of other passengers, mostly men, standing
near by and they joked with us because we were going out on the
ocean. “The ship can’t sink,” said one of them. “You will get your
death of cold out there in the ice.”</p>

<h3>CRUISED AMONG ICE FOR TWO HOURS.</h3>

<p>“We were slung off and the stokers began to row us away. We
cruised around among the ice for two hours. Sir Cosmo had looked
at his watch when we went off. It was exactly 12.15 A. M., and I
should think fifteen minutes after the boat struck. It did not seem
to be very cold. There was no excitement aboard the Titanic.</p>

<p>“Suddenly I had seen the Titanic give a curious shiver. The
night was perfectly clear. There was no fog, and I think we were
a thousand feet away. Everything could be clearly seen. There
were no lights on the boats except a few lanterns which had been
lighted by those on board.</p>

<p>“Almost immediately after the boat gave this shiver we heard
several pistol shots and a great screaming arose from the decks.</p>

<p>“Then the boat’s stern lifted in the air and there was a tremendous
explosion. Then the Titanic dropped back again. The awful
screaming continued. Ten minutes after this there was another explosion.
The whole forward part of the great liner dropped down
under the waves. The stern rose a hundred feet, almost perpendicularly.
The boat stood up like an enormous black finger against
the sky. The screaming was agonizing. I never heard such a continued
chorus of utter despair and agony.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_218">{218}</a></span></p>

<p>“Then there was another great explosion and the great stern
of the Titanic sank as though a great hand was pushing it gently
down under the waves. As it went, the screaming of the poor souls
left on board seemed to grow louder. It took the Titanic but a short
time to sink after that last explosion. It went down slowly without
a ripple.</p>

<p>“We had heard the danger of suction when one of these great
liners sink. There was no such thing about the sinking of the Titanic.
The amazing part of it all to me as I sat there in the boat,
looking at this monster being, was that it all could be accomplished
so gently.</p>

<p>“Then began the real agonies of the night. Up to that time no
one in our boat, and I imagine no one in any of the other boats, had
really thought that the Titanic was going to sink. For a moment
a silence seemed to hang over everything, and then from the water
about where the Titanic had been arose a bedlam of shrieks and
cries. There were women and men clinging to the bits of wreckage
in the icy water.</p>

<h3>AN AWFUL CHORUS OF SHRIEKS.</h3>

<p>“It was at least an hour before the last shrieks died out. I remember
next the very last cry was that of a man who had been calling
loudly: ‘My God! My God!’ He cried monotonously, in a dull,
hopeless way. For an entire hour there had been an awful chorus of
shrieks gradually dying into a hopeless moan until this last cry that
I spoke of. Then all was silent. When the awful silence came we
waited gloomily in the boats throughout the rest of the night.</p>

<p>“At last morning came. On one side of us was the ice floes and
the big bergs, and on the other side we were horrified to see a school
of tremendous whales. Then, as the mist lifted, we caught sight
of the Carpathia looming up in the distance and headed straight
for us.</p>

<p>“We were too numbed by the cold and horror of that awful
night to cheer or even utter a sound. We just gazed at one another
and remained speechless. Indeed, there seemed to be no one among
us who cared much what happened.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_219">{219}</a></span></p>

<p>“Those in the other boats seemed to have suffered more than we
had. We, it seemed, had been miraculously lucky. In one of the
boats was a woman whose clothing was frozen to her body.</p>

<p>“The men on the Carpathia had to chop it off before she could
be taken to a warm room. Several of the stokers and sailors who
had manned the boats had been frozen to death, and they lay stiff
and lifeless in the bottom of the boats, while the women and children
were lifted to the Carpathia.</p>

<p>“I did not see Captain Smith after I was put into the small boat,
but others told me that when the Titanic went down Captain Smith
was seen swimming in the icy water. He picked up a baby that was
floating on a mass of wreckage and swam with it to one of the small
boats. He lifted the baby into the boat, but the child was dead.</p>

<p>“The women in the boat, according to the story told me, wanted
the captain to get into the boat with them, but he refused, saying:
‘No, there is a big piece of wreckage over here, and I shall stick to
that. We are bound to be rescued soon.’ Nothing more was seen of
Captain Smith.</p>

<h3>FIFTEEN BRIDES LOSE THEIR HUSBANDS.</h3>

<p>“There was an absolute calm and silence on the Carpathia.
There were hundreds of women who had lost their husbands, and
among them fifteen brides. Few of these had been married more
than five or six months. No one cared to talk. The gloom was awful.
I buried myself in my cabin and did not come on deck again.”</p>

<p>From Robert Hichens, quartermaster at the wheel of the Titanic
when the great vessel crashed into the iceberg, and then in
command of one of the boats which left the steamship before it went
down, have come details of the terrible sight at sea which could have
been known to perhaps no other person.</p>

<p>And standing out in memory of this young Cornishman are
shrieks and groans that went up from the dark hulk of the giant
steamship before she sank.</p>

<p>Hichens, a type of young Englishman who follows the sea, had
for years been on the troopship Dongolo, running to Bombay, and
thought himself fortunate when he obtained his berth as quarter<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_220">{220}</a></span>master
of the Titanic, the greatest and largest of all steamships. He
told in their sequence the events of the night and morning of April
14 and 15.</p>

<p>It was in his boat that Mrs. John Jacob Astor took her place,
after Col. Astor had kissed her good-by, and handed her a flask of
brandy, then taking his place in the line of men, some of whom realized
even then that the steamship was doomed. And his last sight
as his boat was lowered was of Captain Smith, standing on the
bridge, giving his orders as calmly as if he were directing her entrance
into a harbor.</p>

<p>He told of how the officers stood with revolvers drawn, to enforce,
if the emergency should arise, that rule of the sea of women
first; but the emergency did not arise, and the men stood back or
helped the women to their seats.</p>

<h3>A SEAMAN’S NARRATIVE.</h3>

<p>In the way of a seaman, he told the narrative of the night spent
in the little boat, comforting as best he could the women who did not
realize as he did that some of them had looked upon their loved ones
for the last time.</p>

<p>“My watch was from 8 to 12 o’clock,” said Hichens. “From 8
to 10 o’clock I was the stand-by man, and from 10 to 11 o’clock I
had the wheel. When I was at the stand-by it was very dark, and,
while it was not dark, there was a haze. I cannot say about the
weather conditions after 10 o’clock, for I went into the wheelhouse,
which is enclosed.</p>

<p>“The second officer was the junior watch officer from 8 to 10
o’clock, and at 8 o’clock he sent me to the carpenter with orders for
him to look after the fresh water, as it was going to freeze.</p>

<p>“The thermometer then read 31½ degrees, but so far as could
be seen there was no ice in sight. The next order was from the second
officer for the deck engineer to turn the steam on in the wheelhouse,
as it was getting much colder. Then the second officer, Mr.
Loteheller, told me to telephone the lookout in the crow’s nest.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Tell them,’ he said, ‘to keep a sharp and strict lookout for<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_221">{221}</a></span>
small ice until daylight and to pass the word along to the other lookout
men.’</p>

<p>“I took the wheel at 10 o’clock, and Mr. Murdock, the first officer,
took the watch. It was 20 minutes to 12 and I was steering
when there were the three gongs from the lookout, which indicated
that some object was ahead.</p>

<p>“Almost instantly, it could not have been more than four or five
seconds, when the lookout men called down on the telephone, ‘Iceberg
ahead!’ Hardly had the words come to me when there was a
crash.</p>

<p>“I ain’t likely to forget, sir, how the crash came. There was
a light grating on the port bow, then a heavy crash on the port bow,
then a heavy crash on the starboard side. I could hear the engines
stop, and the lever closing the watertight emergency doors.</p>

<h3>TITANIC SETTLES IN THE WATER.</h3>

<p>“Mr. Murdock was the senior officer of the watch, and with him
on the bridge were Mr. Buxtell, the fourth officer, and Mr. Moody,
the sixth officer. The Titanic listed, perhaps, five degrees, to the
starboard, and then began to settle in the water. I stood attention at
the wheel from the time of the crash until 20 minutes after 12, and
had no chance to see what the captain did.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Potter, Mrs. Earnshaw and Mrs. Stephenson had spoken
freely of the accident to the conductor of the train which took them
home.</p>

<p>“From the descriptions of the scene that followed the accident
given to me by the three ladies,” said the conductor, “it seems utterly
impossible to tell adequately of the suffering and hardship brought
about by the catastrophe. It all happened so suddenly, without a
moment to make the least preparation.</p>

<p>“Most of the passengers had gone to bed. The day had been
clear, and nearly everybody spent the afternoon and evening on the
decks and between 10 and 10.30 o’clock the steamer chairs, smoking
rooms and cafes were gradually vacated. The sea was perfectly
calm, and least expected was the crash which was the sounding note
of the Titanic’s doom.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_222">{222}</a></span></p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>I was in the first lifeboat that was lowered,’ Mrs. Potter told
me. ‘The jar, which tumbled nearly everyone from his berth, was
followed by a wild scramble to the decks. Women in night clothes,
over which were thrown coats, ran distractedly in all directions.
Men almost crazed with excitement, tore madly about trying to
gather together families and relatives, and the confusion was increased
by the orders shouted by the ship’s officers to the crew to
make ready the lifeboats.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Colonel and Mrs. John Jacob Astor were standing near me
when I got into the boat. They did not attempt to leave the ship, and
the last time I saw them together was when they, embracing each
other, watched the first boat lowered.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>I was placed in the boat with Mrs. Thayer. From the boat
we could see ‘Jack’ Thayer jump from the ship. His mother saw
him struggling in the water. We cried to him to swim to our boat.
He tried twice to get into a lifeboat near him, and both times he was
pushed away by persons in it. We saw him swim to an icecake on
which were thirty men. Only ten of them were saved.</p>

<h3>SUFFERED FROM EXPOSURE.</h3>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>In our boat were about twenty persons, most of them women,
who suffered intensely from the exposure. Their scanty clothes
were no protection from the water and ice. Mrs. Thayer rowed us
for more than two hours. She battled with the waves which threatened
to overturn us, and worked as valiantly as any experienced seaman
could have done. To her, for the most part, we owe our lives.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>We did not meet with Mrs. Thayer’s son until we had been
on the Carpathia for twenty-four hours. He had been picked up
from a raft and placed in the ship’s hospital. As soon as he was able
to get about he ran hurriedly through the Carpathia, and there was
a happy meeting when he there saw his mother.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>While the accommodations on the Carpathia were not very
comfortable, the passengers of the Titanic who were rescued by that
vessel were well treated, and feel grateful to the officers and passengers.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>The eight musicians who went down in the Titanic and who<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_223">{223}</a></span>
were playing “Nearer My God to Thee” when all the boats had gone,
were under the leadership of Bandmaster Hartley, who was transferred
from the Mauretania to take up his duties on the largest
steamer of the White Star Line. Under his direction were John
Hume, violinist; Herbert Taylor, pianist; Fred Clark, bass viol;
George Woodward, cellist, and Messrs. Brailey, Krins and Breicoux,
who played when the others were off duty.</p>

<p>On the Celtic were John S. Carr and Louis Cross, cellist and
bass viol of the orchestra on that steamship. When they got shore
leave they told something about the men on the Titanic, with whom
they had made many voyages. They also were acquainted with the
conditions under which the men lived on the Titanic, and gave a
graphic idea of the manner in which they must have responded when
the call of duty came.</p>

<h3>A MAN WITH A HIGH SENSE OF DUTY.</h3>

<p>“Some were already in bed and some were probably smoking
when the ship hit the iceberg,” said John S. Carr. “The Titanic had
a special lounging and smoking room, with the sleeping rooms opening
off it. It was so late that they all must have been there when the
first shock came. Bandmaster Hartley was a man with the highest
sort of a sense of duty.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose he waited to be sent for, but after finding how
dangerous the situation was he probably called his men together and
began playing. I know that he often said that music was a bigger
weapon for stopping disorder than anything on earth. He knew the
value of the weapon he had, and I think he proved his point.”</p>

<p>“The thing that hits me hardest,” said Louis Cross, “is the loss
of Happy Jock Hume, who was one of the violinists. Hume was the
life of every ship he ever played on and was beloved by every one
from cabin boys to captains on the White Star Line. He was a
young Scotchman, not over 21, and came of a musical family.</p>

<p>“His father and his grandfather before him had been violinists
and makers of musical instruments. The name is well known in
Scotland because of it. His real first name was John, but the Scotch
nickname stuck to him, and it was as Jock Hume that he was known<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_224">{224}</a></span>
to every one on the White Star Line, even when he sailed as bandmaster.</p>

<p>“Over in Dumfries, Scotland, I happen to know there’s a sweet
young girl hoping against hope. Jock was to have been married the
next time that he made the trip across the ocean. He was a young
man of exceptional musical ability. If he had lived, I believe he
would not long have remained a member of a ship’s orchestra. He
studied a great deal, although he could pick up without trouble difficult
composition which would have taken others long to learn.</p>

<p>“The odd part of it is that Jock Hume’s mother had a premonition
that something would happen to him on this trip. He was on
the sister ship Olympic a few months ago when, on her maiden voyage,
she collided with the warship Hawk. There was a rent torn in
the side of the Olympic at that time and she had to be towed back to
Belfast.</p>

<h3>A MOTHER’S FATEFUL DREAM.</h3>

<p>“Young Hume went back to his home in Dumfries to spend the
time until she should be repaired, and when his mother heard of
the accident she begged him not to go back to life on the sea. He
told numbers of persons in Liverpool about it. Mrs. Hume had a
dream of some sort, and said she was sure no good would come of it
if he went back.</p>

<p>“Jock had his eye on going in for concert music sooner or later,
but he laughed at his mother’s fears and took the chance to go on the
Titanic. He was known on many ships and had friends in New
York. Last winter he got to know Americans who were wintering
at the Constant Springs Hotel in Kingston, Jamaica.</p>

<p>“He had been bandmaster on the Carmania, of the Cunard Line,
and had played with the orchestra of the Majestic, the California, of
the Anchor Line, and the Megantic, of the White Star Company,
which plies between Liverpool and Montreal.</p>

<p>“Hume was a light hearted, fine tempered young fellow with
curly blond hair, a light complexion and a pleasant smile. He was
the life of every ship he ever sailed on and was full of fun. He is
mourned by every man who knew him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_225">{225}</a></span></p>

<p>“Another thing of which we are all talking is that Fred Clark,
the bass viol of the Titanic, should have gone down on his first trip
across the Atlantic. Clark was well known in concert in Scotland,
and had never shipped before. The White Star people were particularly
anxious to have good music on the first trip of the Titanic,
and offered him good pay to make just one trip. As the winter concert
season had closed, he finally accepted.</p>

<p>“He was 34 years of age and was not married, but had a widowed
mother. He was a well set-up man of a little over medium
height, with black hair, dark complexion, and a high forehead. Clark
was jolly company and of optimistic temperament. Just before he
sailed a number of persons were joking with him about his finally
going to sea, and he said:</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Well, you know it would be just my luck to go down with
the ship. I’ve kept away from it so long it might finish me on this
trip.’ Then he laughed cheerily and all his friends joined in. They
all considered the Titanic as safe as a hotel.</p>

<h3>THE BOAT’S MUSICIANS.</h3>

<p>“Herbert Taylor, the pianist, was considered a master of his
instrument. He was a man of an intellectual turn of mind, with a
thin studious face. He was married, and his home was in London.
About Woodward, the ’cello, I can tell you but little. His home was
in Leeds. The other three men&mdash;Brailey, Krins and Breicoux&mdash;made
up the trio which played in the second cabin and in the restaurant.
They had been playing together for some time, but neither Carr nor
myself shipped with them on any voyage.</p>

<p>“It’s a mistake from the technical point of view to call a steamer’s
orchestra a band,” said Carr. “The term is a survival of the
days when they really had a brass band on board. On all the big
steamships now the music is given by men who are thorough masters
of their instruments. The Titanic orchestra was considered one of
the finest which was ever boated when the ship put out from the
other side, and I think the way the men finished up showed that they
had about as good stuff inside as any who went down in the Atlantic.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_226">{226}</a></span>”</p>

<p>H. E. Steffanson, of New York, another survivor who leaped
into the sea and was picked up, declared that he saw the iceberg before
the collision.</p>

<p>“It seemed to me that the berg, a mile away, I should say, was
about 80 feet out of the water. The ice that showed clear of the
water was not what we struck. After the collision I saw ice all over
the sea. When we hit the berg we seemed to slide up on it. I could
feel the boat jumping and pounding, and I realized that we were on
the ice, but I thought we would weather it. I saw the captain only
once after the collision. He was telling the men to get the women
and children into the boats. I thought then that it was only for precaution,
and it was long after the boats had left that I felt the steamer
sinking.</p>

<p>“I waited on the upper deck until about 2 o’clock. I took a look
below and saw that the Titanic was doomed. Then I jumped into
the ocean and within five minutes I was picked up.”</p>

<h3>DISCIPLINE DESCRIBED AS PERFECT.</h3>

<p>Steffanson also described the discipline upon the boat as perfect.
Many women, as well as men, he said, declined to leave the Titanic,
believing she was safe.</p>

<p>Miss Cornelia Andrews, of Hudson, N. Y., was one of the first
to be put into a lifeboat.</p>

<p>“I saw the Titanic sink,” she said. “I saw her blow up. Our
little boat was a mile away when the end came, but the night was
clear and the ship loomed up plainly, even at that distance. As our
boat put off I saw Mr. and Mrs. Astor standing on the deck. As
we pulled away they waved their hands and smiled at us. We were
in the open boat about four hours before we were picked up.”</p>

<p>E. W. Beans, a second-cabin passenger, was picked up after
swimming in the icy water for twenty minutes. He, too, jumped
into the sea after the boats were lowered.</p>

<p>“I heard a shot fired,” said Beans, “just before I jumped. Afterward
I was told a steerage passenger had been shot while trying
to leap into a lifeboat filled with women and children.”</p>

<p>How the wireless operator on the Carpathia, by putting in an<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_227">{227}</a></span>
extra ten minutes on duty, was a means of saving 745 lives was told
by Dr. J. F. Kemp, the Carpathia’s physician.</p>

<p>“Our wireless operator,” said Dr. Kemp, “was about to retire
Sunday night when he said, jokingly: ‘I guess I’ll wait just ten minutes,
then turn in.’</p>

<p>“It was in the next ten minutes that the Titanic’s call for help
came. Had the wireless man not waited, there would have been no
survivors.”</p>

<p>“The iceberg that sank the Titanic looked to be as big as the
Rock of Gibraltar,” said Thomas Brown, one of the stewards of the
Carpathia, in describing what he saw when the crew of his ship
picked up the survivors from the Titanic. Brown left the Carpathia
a few minutes after she was docked and he gave a vivid description
of the work of the rescue.</p>

<p>“There were 2,341 persons aboard the Titanic, counting officers
and crew,” said the steward. “Seven hundred and ten persons
were saved; so the list of those who drowned numbers 1,631 persons.</p>

<h3>A CLEAR S. O. S. SIGNAL.</h3>

<p>“I had turned in for the night when Main, our wireless operator,
caught the ‘S. O. S.’ signal of distress. He told me it was
the clearest signal of any sort he ever received. The minute he got
the message he hastened to Captain Rostrom and said, ‘Captain, the
Titanic is sinking; she struck an iceberg.’ Captain Rostrom did not
believe it. ‘Here it comes again, Captain,’ said the operator.</p>

<p>“That was all the captain needed to get our crew into action:
he sounded the bell for the watchman, and sent him to order all
hands on deck.</p>

<p>“I doubt if any passengers on the Carpathia knew of the tragedy
until Jones, the first mate, sounded the emergency gong after the
watchman had summoned the crew.</p>

<p>“A few minutes after we got the signal for help we were ready
for action. The ‘S. O. S.’ reached us shortly after midnight. We
were then 56 miles away from the Titanic. Our engineer turned
about and put on full speed, and we reached the Titanic about 3.30
o’clock Monday morning.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_228">{228}</a></span></p>

<p>“While the Carpathia was speeding toward the doomed ship
Captain Rostrom summoned the higher officers together, and said
he would hold every man responsible for the work assigned to him.</p>

<p>“He told Main to answer the Titanic and tell Captain Smith
that we were making for his ship, full steam ahead.</p>

<p>“Phillips, the operators of the Titanic, evidently did not get our
reply, or, if he did receive it, he could not answer us in any way.
Captain Rostrom told Mrs. Smith, the stewardess, to prepare for
any emergency. He told me to get coffee, sandwiches and other
food ready for the survivors.</p>

<p>“On our way to the Titanic the captain went below and told the
engineer that he must get to the Titanic before she sank. I doubt
if Captain Rostrom ever got as much speed out of the Carpathia as
he did on the way to the Titanic.</p>

<p>“Long before the Carpathia got near the scene of the wreck
our boats were ready to be lowered into the water.</p>

<h3>PROMPTNESS IN HANDLING LIFEBOATS.</h3>

<p>“Two men were stationed at each boat, and I and Thomas McKenna,
seaman, were in charge of boat No. 1. We have sixteen
boats on the ship, and they were hanging suspended from the davits
within fifteen minutes after we received the ‘S. O. S.’ call for help.</p>

<p>“I must not forget the women who were on the Carpathia. They
were the most self-sacrificing women I ever saw. Their fortitude
under the distressing circumstances was so remarkable that each one
ought to be rewarded for the work she did after the survivors were
lifted aboard the Carpathia.</p>

<p>“As we got near the scene of the wreck the barometer dropped
considerably. It became cold&mdash;bitter cold. We did not see the icebergs
then, but Captain Rostrom said that we were nearing them.
Suddenly, as the iceberg loomed up ahead of our ship, Captain Rostrom
ran to the pilot house and took charge of the helm.</p>

<p>“The night was clear and starlight, but we did not see an iceberg
until the Carpathia was within a half mile of it. Of course, we
had ample time to steer clear of the floes.</p>

<p>“At 3.30 o’clock our vessel plunged into a sea of open ice. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_229">{229}</a></span>
believe there must have been thirty or forty icebergs in the water
around the Carpathia. Captain Rostrom took his ship safely through
the floe and suddenly we heard a shriek. It was faint at first and
then it became louder.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>The women and children, get them first,’ Captain Rostrom
shouted to the crew on the boat deck who were awaiting the signal
to cut loose lifeboats. Our searchlight was trained on the sea ahead
and the boats filled with the shipwrecked passengers stood out in
bold relief.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget the sight. There were many boats from
the Titanic loaded with women and children wedged among the ice.
Even before we got up to the first boat from the Titanic we could
see the iceberg which sank her. It looked to be as big as the Rock
of Gibraltar. It towered high in the air and it moved very slowly.</p>

<h3>AVOIDS CRASHING INTO SHIPWRECKED PASSENGERS.</h3>

<p>“I believe it was over 500 feet high, and we can judge by its
size by recalling that seven-eighths of an iceberg is submerged.
Within fifty yards of the boats in the water Captain Rostrom gave
the signal to reverse the engines so our ship would not crash into the
shipwrecked passengers.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Ready men&mdash;go,’ shouted the captain to me, and McKenna
loosened the rope and our boat dropped into the water. We tugged
away at the oars with all our strength. We shoved our boat alongside
of boat No. 13 from the Titanic. It was filled with passengers.
I believe there were about fifteen children in it.</p>

<p>“Poor little things! Some were benumbed with cold; others
were apparently lifeless, and several moaned piteously. The women
in the boat were scantily clad. Their clothing was grotesque. They
had on wraps, night robes, silk shawls over their heads and men’s
coats around them. Many had no shoes, and all of them suffered
from the cold.</p>

<p>“McKenna and I tied a hawser to the boat and then rowed back
to the Carpathia. Harris, the bos’n’s mate, and another member of
the crew helped us to lift the unfortunate ones from the boat. Some
had to be carried up the ladder to the boat deck of the Carpathia.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_230">{230}</a></span></p>

<p>“A few could walk, but the majority were so benumbed that
they could neither speak nor walk.</p>

<p>“As fast as others of our crew could get the Titanic’s boats
they were dragged toward the side of the Carpathia. We rescued
twenty boatloads of passengers&mdash;710 in all. Our ship resembled a
hospital on our way back to New York, for a number of the women
and children were ill.</p>

<p>“The three physicians on the Carpathia told me as we were going
up the bay that there were sixteen patients for the hospital as
soon as the Carpathia docked.”</p>

<p>From a little porthole on the side of the Carpathia a woman
passenger told how the wireless call from the wrecked Titanic sent
the Cunard liner racing to the rescue; how the fainting, hysterical
survivors were taken from the lifeboats, and of the nerve-wrecking
scenes that followed on board the rescue ship.</p>

<h3>A NARRATIVE ON THE TUG BOAT REYNOLDS.</h3>

<p>The narrative was told to persons on the tug boat Reynolds as
the latter sped side by side with the Carpathia as she moved up the
North river to her berth at the Cunard pier. The woman thrust her
head through the porthole of the liner in response to megaphone
calls shouted from the Reynolds.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble now?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Tell us about the wreck of the Titanic. Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Miss Peterson, of Passaic, N. J.,” was the answer. She was
a passenger on the Carpathia.</p>

<p>The captain of the Reynolds, William Bennett, turned his craft
closer to the Carpathia, so those on the tug could get within speaking
distance.</p>

<p>“It’s almost too horrible to speak about,” began Miss Peterson.
“It seems like a dream. I was asleep in my berth. I had walked
along the promenade deck until about 10 o’clock and had gone to my
room and fallen asleep. Suddenly I heard a deep blast from the
horns. I awoke startled.</p>

<p>“Then came another blast. The lights were turned on all over
the ship. I heard the officers and crew running up and down the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_231">{231}</a></span>
decks. I dressed hurriedly, thinking something was wrong on the
Carpathia. I hastened to the deck. It was about 2 o’clock in the
morning and the stars were shining brightly overhead.</p>

<p>“I met Captain Rostrom and asked what was the trouble. ‘The
Titanic has struck an iceberg and is sinking. Great God, men,’ he
shouted, turning to his officers, ‘get ready to save these poor souls.
There must be 2,500 on board.’</p>

<p>“Before the captain had told us of the wreck the Carpathia was
being turned around toward the Titanic. I went on the boat deck
and met many of our passengers. I heard the wireless buzz, and I
knew the operator was trying to talk to the Titanic. I tried to get
below to see the wireless instrument and operator, but I was told to
go on deck again. The operator was clad only in his trousers and
undershirt.</p>

<p>“Captain Rostrom said: ‘Can’t you get her?’ ‘No,’ replied the
operator, ‘she doesn’t answer.’</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>She’s going down,’ said Captain Rostrom, and he ordered the
engineer to put on full speed.</p>

<h3>SPEEDED FASTER THAN USUAL.</h3>

<p>“I don’t know how fast we went, but the speed of the Carpathia
at that time was greater by far than the way we had been traveling
on our way across the ocean. You can imagine the excitement aboard
the Carpathia. Everyone was dressed and on deck before we got to
the Titanic, or rather what was left of her.</p>

<p>“I guess it was about 3.30 o’clock when we got near the boats
of the Titanic. The Carpathia had all her boats hanging on the
davits and Captain Rostrom was ready. I heard women scream as
the Carpathia approached the Titanic’s boats. I shrieked with them
because every one was saying, ‘Oh, oh, it’s awful, awful.’ I saw the
first boat of the Titanic taken from the water.</p>

<p>“I saw the icebergs all around the boats. I wonder now how
they kept afloat. Before the Carpathia had slackened speed much a
lifeboat from our ship was in the water and the men were pushing
toward the other boats.</p>

<p>“They tied a rope to the Titanic’s boats and then moved back<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_232">{232}</a></span>
to the Carpathia and the first boatload of survivors were taken from
the water only a few minutes after we saw it.</p>

<p>“There were about fifty women and children in it; some had
fainted and lay motionless. Others were screaming and were hysterical.
There were no men in the boat and none of the survivors
were dressed properly.</p>

<p>“They had on night robes, furs, evening gowns, anything they
could find. Some were almost frozen. A little girl, they called her
Emily, was shrieking, ‘Oh, mama, mama, I’m sick. Oh, mama,
mama!’</p>

<p>“Her mother could not comfort her, because she collapsed as
soon as she was lifted to the deck of the Carpathia. All the women
on our boat got their heavy clothing and threw it around the survivors.
Captain Rostrom told us to take them to our staterooms, and
we did all we could to make them comfortable.</p>

<h3>NEARLY ALL BOATS TAKEN FROM WATER.</h3>

<p>“I did not go on deck again until an hour or more had passed;
by that time the crew of the Carpathia had taken nearly all the boats
from the water. I saw three loads of passengers taken from the
boats and the mate of the Carpathia said there were about 800 saved.
Captain Rostrom had tears in his eyes while he was directing the
work of rescue.</p>

<p>“We were here, there, everywhere it seemed all at once. We
got a few men aboard, but they were not taken from the lifeboats.
It was women and children first.</p>

<p>“Our ship was a hospital ship on April 15. All the women on
our boat offered to give up their staterooms and the captain ordered
many of the survivors placed in our berths.</p>

<p>“The doctors had more than they could do to care for the sick.
Women fainted one after the other. Mrs. Astor was unconscious at
times. She called for her husband time and again, and so we dared
not tell her that Colonel Astor was not aboard.”</p>

<p>A steward from the Carpathia told the following tale of the
rescue of the Titanic’s passengers and crew to a group of his mates:</p>

<p>“It was between quarter after and half after 1 o’clock, shi<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_233">{233}</a></span>p’s
time, Monday morning,” he said, “when all the stewards were mustered
and Chief Steward Highes told us that a wireless had just
come in that the Titanic had hit an iceberg and probably would need
help. He urged us to turn right in and get ready for a ship’s load of
people. The Carpathia turned in the direction the wireless had
called from.</p>

<p>“We got hot coffee ready and laid out blankets and made sandwiches
and everything like that. It seemed as if every passenger
on the boat knew about the trouble and turned out. Captain Rostrom
had shut off the hot water all over the ship and turned every
ounce of heat into steam, and the old boat was as excited as any of us.</p>

<p>“After we got things ready we went out on deck. It was a
glorious morning&mdash;no swell in the sea, but bitter cold. The ship’s
lights were on full blaze and we were there in the middle of a sea of
ice&mdash;the finest sight I ever saw.</p>

<h3>COMPARATIVELY EMPTY BOAT WITHOUT WOMEN.</h3>

<p>“Just as it was about half day and dark we came upon a boat.
There were eighteen men in it and it was in charge of an officer.
There were no women in the boat, and it was not more than one-third
filled. All of the men were able to come up the Jacob’s ladder
on the Carpathia, which we threw over the port side. Every one of
them was given some brandy or hot black coffee. After they were
all on board we pulled up their boat.</p>

<p>“It was bright morning by now and all around the Carpathia,
here and there, about a quarter mile apart, were more boats. These
were fuller than the first and there were women in all of them. The
women were hoisted up in bo’suns chairs, and the men who could do
so climbed the Jacob’s ladder. Some of the men, however, had to be
hauled up, especially the firemen. There was a whole batch of firemen
saved. They were nearly naked. They had jumped overboard
and swam after the boats, it turned out, and they were almost frozen
stiff.</p>

<p>“The women were dressed, and the funny thing about it is only
five of them had to be taken to the hospital. Both the men’s hospitals
were filled&mdash;twenty-four beds in all. We got twelve boatloads,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_234">{234}</a></span>
I think, inside of a little more than an hour. Then, between quarter
after and half after 8 o’clock, we got the last two boats&mdash;crowded to
the guards and almost all women.</p>

<p>“After we got the last boatload aboard the Californian came
alongside and the captains arranged that we should make straight
for New York and the Californian would look around for more
boats. We circled round and round, though, and we saw all kinds
of wreckage. There was not a person on a stick of it and we did
not get sight of another soul.</p>

<p>“While we were pulling in the boatloads of women we saved
were quiet enough and not making any trouble at all. But when it
seemed sure we would not find any more persons alive then bedlam
came.</p>

<p>“I hope I never go through it again. The way those women
took on for the folks they had lost was awful and we could not do
anything to quiet them until they cried themselves out.</p>

<p>“There were five Chinamen in the boats and not a soul knew
where they came from. No one saw them get into the boats; but
there they were&mdash;wherever they came from.</p>

<p>“The fellows from the crew of the Titanic told us that lots
more of them could have got away, only no one would believe that
their ship could sink.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_235">{235}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Managing Director of the White Star Line, J. Bruce Ismay;
Captain Rostrom, of the Carpathia; Guglielmo Marconi, inventor
of wireless; the second officer of the Titanic and others testified
before the Senate committee which was investigating the disaster
that caused the loss of more than 1600 lives when the Titanic
hit an iceberg.</p>

<p>Mr. Ismay was visibly nervous when he took the stand to
testify in the Waldorf-Astoria, where the hearings were being
held.</p>

<p>Several times he avoided direct answers by saying: “I know
nothing about it.” Little if any light was thrown on the sea
tragedy by his testimony.</p>

<p>That the Titanic’s rate of speed was approximately 26½

<p>He was not sure in just what boat he left the Titanic, nor
was he sure how long he remained on the liner after she struck.</p>

<p>He added, however, that before he entered a lifeboat he had
been told that there were no more women on the deck, and he
denied that there had been any censorship of messages from the
Carpathia.</p>

<p>The seriousness of the inquiry by the Senate investigating
committee in the Titanic disaster was disclosed when Senator
Smith, of Michigan, the chairman, at first flatly refused to let<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_236">{236}</a></span>
any of the officers or the 200 odd members of the crew of the
sunken steamship get beyond the jurisdiction of the United
States Government. The men were all to have sailed on the
steamer Lapland.</p>

<p>Later it was settled that the greater part of the crew would
be permitted to sail on this steamer, but that the twelve men and
four officers among the survivors now under subpena, together
with Mr. Ismay, would not be allowed to depart.</p>

<p>Captain Rostrom told a simple, apparently straightforward
story, thrilling from its very simplicity and the sailorman quality
of the narrative.</p>

<p>He answered questions direct and gave the first authoritative
tale of the hearing of the appeal for help, the rush to aid the
sinking liner and the sighting of the ship’s boats and picking
them up, the preparations made, while the Carpathia was being
urged along under every ounce of steam its boilers could make, to
provide for the reception of the survivors on board.</p>

<h3>CAPTAIN ROSTROM’S DENIAL.</h3>

<p>Captain Rostrom denied emphatically there was any intention
on his part to disregard the inquiry made by the President
of the United States or that any censorship was exercised over
wireless messages by any person other than himself.</p>

<p>Charles W. Lightholder, second officer of the Titanic and
senior surviving officer of the ship, told of what preceded the
sinking of the Titanic, what happened while women were taken
away in boats as brave men stood by, and what happened when
the Titanic took her last dip. It was a story of heroism, told
quietly and calmly.</p>

<p>Lightholder said that tests of the water had been made for
ice. It was part of the routine. Water was taken from the side
of the ship in canvas buckets and the temperature learned by
putting a thermometer in it.</p>

<p>As the second officer of the ship, Lightholder said he had
been in charge of it on Sunday when the Titanic struck, from 6<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_237">{237}</a></span>
o’clock in the evening until 10, or inside of two hours before the
collision.</p>

<p>He would not admit that the tests were being made solely
for the purpose of searching for information as to icebergs.</p>

<p>It was part of the routine of the ship. The tests were made
for routing purposes and other purposes. The water was not
much above freezing.</p>

<p>The witness said that he did not know what the tests of the
water that day showed. No reports had been made to him. He
did not think it necessary that night, when he was on the bridge
in charge, to make tests for the purpose of finding out if the Titanic
was in the vicinity of icebergs.</p>

<h3>ICEBERGS REPORTED.</h3>

<p>“Did you know that the Amerika had reported to the Titanic
the location of icebergs in that neighborhood?” asked Senator
Smith.</p>

<p>“I heard of the message, but I didn’t know that it was the
Amerika.”</p>

<p>“Did you get from Captain Smith that night any information
about the icebergs?”</p>

<p>“Not that night,” said Lightholder. “I think it was in the
afternoon, about 1 o’clock. I was on the bridge, having relieved
First Officer Murdock, who had gone to lunch.”</p>

<p>Captain Smith, he said, told him of the wireless message
from the Amerika about the icebergs. Lightholder said he
couldn’t recall just what position the ship was in then, but he
could work it out on the chart.</p>

<p>When Chief Officer Murdock returned to the bridge, Lightholder
said, he told him exactly the information Captain Smith
had communicated to him.</p>

<p>“What did Murdock say?” asked Senator Smith. “All
right,” replied Lightholder.</p>

<p>“So the chief officer of the ship was fully advised by you
that you were in proximity to icebergs?” he was asked. “Yes,
sir.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_238">{238}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“How fast was the boat going at that time?” “Between
21½ and 22 knots.”</p>

<p>“Was that her maximum speed?” “So far as we knew,”
said Lightholder, “she could go faster than that if pushed. We
understood that that was not her maximum speed.”</p>

<p>“During your voyage, did you know you were in the vicinity
of ice?” Senator Smith asked. “I knew some had been reported.”</p>

<p>He said the ship was not in proximity to icebergs Saturday
or Sunday, although he knew the ship would be near ice on Sunday
night. The witness said he knew nothing of the Amerika
and the Titanic talking by wireless about icebergs.</p>

<p>Senator Smith asked if he sought to send any wireless messages
from the Titanic after she struck. He said not.</p>

<h3>MR. ISMAY’S REMARKS.</h3>

<p>Turning to the subject of lifeboats, Mr. Ismay said he heard
the captain give the order to lower the boats. “I then left the
bridge.” Three boats, he said, he saw lowered and filled. In his
own boat were four members of the crew and forty-five passengers.</p>

<p>“Was there any jostling or attempt by men to get into the
boats?” asked Senator Smith. “I saw none.”</p>

<p>“How were the women selected?” “We picked the women
and children as they stood nearest the rail.”</p>

<p>Representative Hughes handed Senator Smith a note, and
then the chairman told Mr. Ismay that it was reported that the
second lifeboat left without its full complement of oarsmen, and
from 11.30 until 7.30 women were forced to row the boat. “I
know nothing about it.”</p>

<p>Representative Hughes’ daughter was in this boat and was
assigned to watch the cork in the boat and, if it came out, to use
her finger as a stopper.</p>

<p>Then Senator Smith asked the circumstances under which
he left the boat. “The boat was being filled,” began Mr. Ismay.
“The officers called out to know if there were any more women<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_239">{239}</a></span>
to go. There were none. No passengers were on the deck. So
as the boat was being lowered I got into it.”</p>

<p>“The ship was sinking?” asked Senator Smith. “The boat
was sinking,” almost whispered Mr. Ismay.</p>

<p>“Was there any attempt to lower the boats of the Carpathia
to take on passengers after you went aboard her?” asked Senator
Smith. “There were no passengers there to take on,” said Mr.
Ismay.</p>

<p>He said he saw no liferafts in the sea.</p>

<p>“How many lifeboats were there on the Titanic?” “Twenty
altogether, I think,” said Mr. Ismay, “sixteen collapsible and
four wooden boats.” Whether the boats were taken on board
the Carpathia or not he did not know.</p>

<p>“It has been suggested,” Senator Smith continued, “that
two of the lifeboats sank as soon as lowered. Do you know
anything about that?” “I do not. I never heard of it, and I
think all the lifeboats were accounted for.”</p>

<h3>NO INDICATIONS OF TITANIC’S BREAKING.</h3>

<p>“When you last saw her were there indications that the Titanic
had broken in two?” “No, there was no such indication.”</p>

<p>“How long after you left her was it that you looked back for
the last time?” “It may have been ten minutes or a half hour.
I am not sure. Impossible for me to tell.”</p>

<p>“Was there confusion apparent on the Titanic when you
looked back?” “I didn’t see any. All I saw was the green light
the last time I looked.”</p>

<p>“After you left Captain Smith on the bridge did you see him
again?” “I did not.”</p>

<p>“Did you have any message from him?” “None.”</p>

<p>“How many wireless operators were there on the Titanic?”
“I presume there were two. One is always on watch.”</p>

<p>“Did they survive?” “I have been told one did, but I do
not know whether it is true or not.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ismay was asked what he had on when he got into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_240">{240}</a></span>
lifeboat. “A pair of slippers, a pair of pajamas, a suit of clothes
and an overcoat.”</p>

<p>Captain Rostrom, of the Carpathia, followed Mr. Ismay.
He told Mr. Smith that he had been captain of the Carpathia
since last January, but that he had been a seaman twenty-seven
years.</p>

<p>The captain told in detail of the arrangements made to prepare
the lifeboats and the ship for the receipt of the survivors.</p>

<p>Arriving at the zone of the accident, Captain Rostrom testified,
he saw an iceberg straight ahead of him and, stopping at 4
A. M., ten minutes later he picked up the first lifeboat. The officer
sang out he had only one seaman on board and was having
difficulty in manning his boat.</p>

<h3>ICEBERGS ON EVERY SIDE.</h3>

<p>“By the time I got the boat aboard day was breaking,” said
the captain. “In a radius of four miles I saw all the other lifeboats.
On all sides of us were icebergs; some twenty, some were
150 to 200 feet high, and numerous small icebergs or ‘growlers.’
Wreckage was strewn about us. At 8.30 all the Titanic’s survivors
were aboard.”</p>

<p>Then, with tears filling his eyes, Captain Rostrom said he
called the purser. “I told him,” said Captain Rostrom, “I wanted
to hold a service of prayer&mdash;thanksgiving for the living and a
funeral service for the dead.</p>

<p>“I went to Mr. Ismay. He told me to take full charge. An
Episcopal clergyman was found among the passengers, and he
conducted the services.”</p>

<p>As the prayers were being said, Captain Rostrom testified,
he was on the bridge searching for survivors. He told of talking
with the California, which had arrived. As he searched the
sea, one body with a life preserver on floated by.</p>

<p>The man was dead, probably a member of the crew, the captain
said. The body was not picked up, the officer explaining,
“because the survivors of the Titanic were in no condition then
to see a body brought aboard.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_241">{241}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“But I must say,” declared Captain Rostrom with positiveness,
“every one of the survivors behaved magnificently. They
sat in the boats until the order came for them to mount the ladder
in turn, and then came up.”</p>

<p>Asked about the lifeboats, Captain Rostrom said he found
one among the wreckage in the sea. Several of the lifeboats
brought in on the Carpathia to New York, he said, were lowered
last night and hauled away by tenders, he knew not where.</p>

<p>Captain Rostrom said that the Carpathia had twenty lifeboats
of her own, in accordance with the British regulations.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t that indicate that the regulations are out of date,
your ship being much smaller than the Titanic, which also carried
twenty lifeboats?” Senator Smith asked. “No. The Titanic
was supposed to be a lifeboat herself.”</p>

<p>Captain Rostrom then explained that it was for the good of
the shipwrecked people that he brought his ship to New York
instead of going to Halifax.</p>

<h3>WOMEN AT THE OARS.</h3>

<p>At Representative Hughes’ suggestion, Captain Rostrom
was asked further about the lifeboat with one officer and one
seaman in it. This was the boat from which the Representative’s
daughter was rescued. At least two women were rowing
in this boat. In another lifeboat he saw women at the oars, but
how many he could not tell.</p>

<p>In discussing the strength of the Carpathia’s wireless, Captain
Rostrom said the Carpathia was only 58 miles from the Titanic
when the call for help came. “Our wireless operator was
not on duty,” said Captain Rostrom, “but as he was undressing
he had his apparatus to his ear. Ten minutes later he would
have been in bed and we never would have heard.”</p>

<p>Mr. Marconi took the stand as soon as the hearing was resumed
for the afternoon. He said he was the chairman of the
British Marconi Company. Under instructions of the company,
he said operators must take their orders from the captain of the
ship on which they are employed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_242">{242}</a></span></p>

<p>“Do the regulations prescribe whether one or two operators
should be aboard the ocean vessels?” “Yes, on ships like the
Titanic and Olympic two are carried,” said Mr. Marconi. “The
Carpathia, a smaller boat, carries one. The Carpathia’s wireless
apparatus is a short-distance equipment. The maximum
efficiency of the Carpathia’s wireless, I should say, was 200 miles.
The wireless equipment on the Titanic was available 500 miles
during the daytime and 1000 miles at night.”</p>

<p>“Do you consider that the Titanic was equipped with the
latest improved wireless apparatus?” “Yes, I should say that
it had the very best.”</p>

<p>Charles Herbert Lightholder, second officer of the Titanic,
followed Mr. Marconi on the stand. Mr. Lightholder said he
understood the maximum speed of the Titanic, as shown by its
trial tests, to have been 22½ to 23 knots. Senator Smith asked
if the rule requiring life-saving apparatus to be in each room for
each passenger was complied with.</p>

<h3>LIFE-SAVING EQUIPMENT INSPECTED.</h3>

<p>“Everything was complete,” said Lightholder. Sixteen
lifeboats, of which four were collapsible, were on the Titanic, he
added. During the tests, he said, Captain Clark, of the British
Board of Trade, was aboard the Titanic to inspect its life-saving
equipment.</p>

<p>“How thorough are these captains of the Board of Trade in
inspecting ships?” asked Senator Smith. “Captain Clark is so
thorough that we called him a nuisance.”</p>

<p>Lightholder said he was in the sea with a lifebelt on one
hour and a half.</p>

<p>“What time did you leave the ship?” “I didn’t leave it.”</p>

<p>“Did it leave you?” “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Where were you when the Titanic sank?” “In the officers’
quarters.”</p>

<p>“Were all the lifeboats gone then?” “All but one. I was
about fifteen feet from it. It was hanging in the tackle, and they
were trying to get it over the bulwarks the last time I saw it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_243">{243}</a></span>
The first officer, Mr. Murdock, who lost his life, was managing
the tackle.”</p>

<p>The last boat, a flat collapsible, to put off was the one on
top the officers’ quarters, Lightholder said. Men jumped upon
it on deck and waited for the water to float it off. Once at sea,
it upset. The forward funnel fell into the water, just missing
the raft, and overturning it. The funnel probably killed persons
in the water.</p>

<p>“This was the boat I eventually got on,” declared Lightholder.
“No one was on it when I reached it. Later about
thirty men clambered out of the water on to it. All had on life
preservers.”</p>

<h3>DIED AND SLIPPED OFF INTO THE WATER.</h3>

<p>“Did any passengers get on?” asked Senator Smith. “J. B.
Thayer, the second Marconi operator and Colonel Gracie I recall,”
said the witness. “All the rest were firemen taken out of
the water. Two of these died that night and slipped off into the
water. I think the senior Marconi operator did that.”</p>

<p>“Did you see any attempt to get women to go who would
not?” “Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why would they not go?” “I hadn’t time to learn.”</p>

<p>“Did any ask for their family to go?” “Yes, one or two.”</p>

<p>“Did any families go?” “No.”</p>

<p>In the first boat to put off, Lightholder said, he put twenty
to twenty-five. Two seamen were placed in it. The officer said
he could spare no more and that the fact that women rowed did
not show the boat was not fully equipped.</p>

<p>At that time he did not believe the danger was great. Two
seamen placed in the boat he said were selected by him, but he
could not recall who they were.</p>

<p>“The third boat?” “By the time I came to the third boat&mdash;all
these on the portside&mdash;I began to realize that the situation
was serious and I began to take chances.”</p>

<p>“How long did all the work of loading and lowering a life<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_244">{244}</a></span>boat
take?” “It was difficult to say, but I think about fifteen or
twenty minutes.”</p>

<p>“How many passengers did the third boat contain?” “I
filled it up as full as I dared, sir, then lowered it; about thirty-five,
I think. The women and children couldn’t have stood quieter if
they’d been in church.”</p>

<p>In loading the fourth lifeboat Lightholder said he was running
short of seamen. “I put two seamen in and one jumped
out. That was the first boat I had to put a man passenger in.
He was standing nearby and said he would go if I needed him.</p>

<p>“I said, ‘Are you a sailor?’ and he replied that he was a
yachtsman. Then I told him that if he was sailor enough to get
out over the bulwarks to the lifeboat to go ahead. He did and
proved himself afterward to be a very brave man.”</p>

<p>“Who was he&mdash;did you know him?” “I didn’t know him
then, but afterward I looked him up. He was Major Peuchen,
of Toronto.”</p>

<p>“Had you ever seen him before?” “Never.”</p>

<h3>DIFFICULTY IN FINDING WOMEN.</h3>

<p>Of the fifth boat Lightholder had no particular recollection.
“The last boat I put out, my sixth boat,” he said, “we had difficulty
finding women. I called for women and none were on
deck. The men began to get in&mdash;and then women appeared.
As rapidly as they did the men passengers got out of the boats
again.</p>

<p>“The boat’s deck was only ten feet from the water when I
lowered the sixth boat. When we lowered the first the distance
to the water was 70 feet.” All told, Lightholder testified, 210
members of the crew were saved.</p>

<p>Lightholder declared he stood on top the officers’ quarters
and as the ship dived he faced forward and dived also. “I was
sucked against a blower and held there,” testified the officer.</p>

<p>“Head above water?” “No, sir. A terrific gust came up
the blower&mdash;the boilers must have exploded&mdash;and I was blown
clear.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_245">{245}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“How far were you blown?” “Barely clear. I was sucked
down again; this time on the ‘fidley’ grating.”</p>

<p>“Did anyone else have a similar experience?” “Yes, Colonel
Gracie.”</p>

<p>“How did you get loose?” “I don’t know, maybe another
explosion. All I know is we came up by a boat.”</p>

<p>“Were there any watertight compartments on that ship?”
the Senator asked. “Certainly, forty or fifty.”</p>

<p>Thomas Cottam, 21 years old, of Liverpool, the Marconi operator
on the Carpathia, was the first witness at the evening session.</p>

<p>He denied himself some glory by saying he had no stated
hours for labor on the Carpathia. Previous witnesses had testified
he was not “on duty” when he received the Titanic’s signal
for help.</p>

<h3>UNCERTAIN AS TO THE KIND OF WORK.</h3>

<p>He was decidedly uncertain whether he was required to
work at night, finally saying it depended on whether he had commercial
or ship’s business to get off.</p>

<p>“What were you doing last Sunday evening about 10
o’clock?” asked Senator Smith. “Receiving news from Cape
Cod,” said Cottam. He said he had also been “sending a lot of
messages for the Titanic.”</p>

<p>“Had you closed your station for the night?” “No.”</p>

<p>“What do you do when you close your station?” “Switch
the storage battery out,” said Cottam.</p>

<p>“Does that prevent receiving or sending messages?” the
Senator continued. “No.”</p>

<p>“Does it lessen the likelihood of your getting a signal of any
kind?” “No, not in the least,” Cottam replied.</p>

<p>“You say the Carpathia wireless instruments would send a
message about 250 miles with accuracy?” “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Was there any thunder or lightning Sunday night?” “No,
it was clear.”</p>

<p>“Well, how did you happen to catch the Titanic message of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_246">{246}</a></span>
distress?” “I was looking out for a confirmation by the steamer
Parisian of a previous message from the Parisian&mdash;a message
that came some time in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear the captain of the Carpathia testify here today?”
“No.”</p>

<p>“He said you were about to retire and caught this Titanic
distress message rather providentially?” “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“How far had you got along in your arrangement to retire?
Had you taken off your clothes?” “Yes, my coat.”</p>

<p>“Did you have any instruments then?” “Yes, the telephones
were on my head. I was waiting for the Parisian’s answer.
I had just called it.”</p>

<p>“How long would you have waited?” “Several minutes.”</p>

<p>“Would you have retired pretty soon, you think?” “Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, when you got the distress message from the Titanic
Sunday night, how did you get it?” “I called the Titanic myself,
sir.”</p>

<h3>SENDING MESSAGES TO THE TITANIC.</h3>

<p>“Who told you to call the Titanic?” “No one, sir. I did it
of my own free will. I asked the Titanic operator if he was
aware that Cape Cod had been sending messages for the Titanic.”</p>

<p>“What was the answer?” “<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Come at once’ was the message,
sir,” said Cottam.</p>

<p>“Was that all of it?” “No, the operator said, I think, ‘come
at once&mdash;this is a distress message. C. Q. D.’<span class="lftspc">”</span> Cottam testified.</p>

<p>When word of the Titanic’s distress was received, Operator
Cottam said he immediately sent them the position of the Carpathia
and added that they would hurry to the rescue.</p>

<p>“Get any reply to that?” asked Senator Smith. “Yes, sir;
immediately. They acknowledged receipt of it.”</p>

<p>The witness said the next communication with the Titanic
was four minutes later, when he confirmed the position of both
vessels. At this juncture the Frankfurt, of the North German
Lloyd Line, broke in on the communication, having heard the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_247">{247}</a></span>
Titanic’s call for help. Later the steamship Olympic also replied.</p>

<p>“What did you do then?” asked Senator Smith. “I called
the attention of the Titanic to the Olympic’s efforts to raise it,”
answered the witness. “The Titanic replied it could not hear
because of the rush of air and the noise made by the escaping
steam.”</p>

<p>Immediately after telling the Titanic of the Olympic’s attempt
to get in communication with her, the former, the witness
said, sought the Olympic’s aid, reporting that it was “head down”
and giving its position. The Baltic broke in at this time, but its
efforts to reach the Titanic were without avail.</p>

<p>“I was in communication with the Titanic at regular intervals
until the final message,” said Cottam. “This was ‘come
quick; our engine room is filling up to the boilers.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>“What was your condition?” asked Senator Smith. “I was
desperately tired. I was worked out,” answered Cottam, who
was then excused.</p>

<p>The committee adjourned at 10.20 o’clock to meet at 10
o’clock the next morning.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_248">{248}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.<br><br>
SURVIVING OPERATOR’S EXPERIENCES.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">Surviving Operator’s Experiences&mdash;Tells Senator How He Escaped&mdash;Tale
of Suffering and Death&mdash;Managing Director’s
Flight Balked&mdash;Long Hours and Low Wages for Wireless
Men&mdash;Refused Help from Frankfurt&mdash;Called Its Operator
a Fool&mdash;Laxity of Wireless&mdash;Denies Sending “Saved” Message&mdash;Gave
Warning of Ice.</p></div>

<p>With J. Bruce Ismay, managing director, and P. A. S. Franklin,
general manager of the White Star Line, Harold Thomas
Cottam, wireless operator on the Carpathia; Harold Bride, surviving
operator of the Titanic, the five surviving officers from
the ill-fated ship and thirty of her seamen in the custody of the
sergeant-at-arms of the United States Senate, Senator Smith, of
Michigan, and Francis G. Newlands, of Nevada, brought their
investigation of the greatest sea horror of modern times to a
close so far as New York was concerned.</p>

<p>When the men of the Titanic, British seamen, had been
heard under oath by the committee they were allowed to return
to their homes, where they were subject to the call of their own
government.</p>

<p>“We must hear the Englishmen first,” said Chairman Smith,
a few minutes before he and Senator Newlands left shortly after
midnight for Washington, “because they need to get back home
as soon as possible. We will be able to get the Americans whenever
we want them.”</p>

<p>It had been suggested to Chairman Smith that the British
Government might offer objections to the keeping of British seamen
in this country under the circumstances.</p>

<p>“I am proceeding,” said Mr. Smith, “just as if there was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_249">{249}</a></span>
the slightest possibility of such a protest. Should one come we
will deal with it at that time.”</p>

<p>The committee had in mind the drafting of important legislation
as the result of its hearing. Regulation of the use of the
air by wireless operators so as to prevent interference in times
of wreck at sea is one law that seemed almost sure to be enacted.
Another was legislation requiring not only American, but
all foreign vessels using American ports to be equipped with
enough lifeboats to take off every passenger and every member
of the ship’s crew if need be. Patrol of the steamship lanes for
icebergs was another.</p>

<p>It seemed likewise not at all unlikely that the committee
would recommend and Congress enact a law requiring ships, at
least those under American registry, to carry two operators so
that one may be on duty while the other sleeps. The President
seemed likely to be asked by a joint resolution of Congress to
open negotiations with foreign powers to establish a new and
much more southerly steamship lane across the Atlantic by international
agreement.</p>

<h3>SENATE TO PROBE FALSE MESSAGE.</h3>

<p>It developed that the Senate Committee intended to make
one of the most important features of its probing work and examination
in the false messages that were given out by the White
Star Line office in New York on Monday when it was said that
the Titanic had struck an iceberg, but that she was in tow of the
Virginian, which was taking her to Halifax and that all on board
were safe.</p>

<p>Incident to the sudden close of the hearing was the story of
Harold S. Bride, the second and only surviving wireless operator
of the Titanic. His tale was one of suffering and of death.</p>

<p>He told of the final plunge of the vessel to its ocean burial.
Its captain’s end also was revealed. He leaped from the bridge
when the waters were closing over his ship.</p>

<p>In connection with the transfer of the hearing to Washington
it was intimated that the power of the Senate on federal ter<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_250">{250}</a></span>ritory
would be undisputed in getting at the real facts and no
question of State rights could arise to interfere.</p>

<p>Throughout the hearing, also, officials of the White Star
Line had portrayed the dangers of sailors’ boarding houses in
New York as a reason why those detained by the committee
should be allowed to sail on the Lapland, which left today.</p>

<p>Throughout the hearing Wireless Operator Bride, crippled
as a result of his experiences and seated in an invalid’s chair, told
his story of the last moments of the Titanic.</p>

<p>His narrative, drawn from him piecemeal by Senator Smith,
of Michigan, chairman of the committee, held enthralled the committee
and the audience.</p>

<p>When his ordeal was ended he was almost on the verge of
collapse.</p>

<h3>THE LAXITY OF THE WIRELESS</h3>

<p>Another phase of the laxity of the wireless, so far as man
is concerned, was developed by the chairman. He drew from
the witness an acknowledgment that on Sunday evening Bride
was sitting, the telephonic apparatus strapped to his ears, adjusting
his accounts, while the steamship Californian, seeking to
warn the Titanic that icebergs were invading the lanes of ocean
travel, called incessantly.</p>

<p>Bride said he heard the call but did not answer because he
was “busy.”</p>

<p>It was not until a half hour later that the Californian, striving
to reach the steamship Baltic, reached also the Titanic,
whereupon the warning that three huge icebergs had been sighted,
was noted by Bride and verbally communicated to the liner’s
captain.</p>

<p>“At this time, however, neither of us worried a bit. When
we heard the confusion on deck I went out to investigate and
when I returned I found Mr. Phillips sending out a “C. Q. D.”
call, giving our position.</p>

<p>“We raised the Frankfurt first and then the Carpathia and
the Baltic. As I have said, we did not try for the Frankfurt for<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_251">{251}</a></span>
any length of time, but concentrated our messages on the Carpathia,
which had answered that she was rushing to our aid.”</p>

<p>“From time to time either Mr. Phillips or I would go on
deck to observe the situation. The last time I went on deck I
found the passengers running around in confusion and there was
almost a panic.</p>

<p>“They were seeking lifebelts. All of the large lifeboats were
gone, but there was one liferaft remaining. It had been lashed on
the top of the quarters on the boat deck. A number of men were
striving to launch it.</p>

<p>“I went back to the wireless cabin then. Mr. Phillips was
striving to send out a final ‘C. Q. D.’ call. The power was so low
that we could not tell exactly whether it was being carried or
not, for we were in a closed cabin and we could not hear the
crackle of the wireless at the mast.</p>

<h3>BOTH CARED FOR A WOMAN</h3>

<p>Phillips kept on sending, however, while I buckled on his
lifebelt and put on my own. Then we both cared for a woman
who had fainted and who had been brought into our cabin.</p>

<p>“Then, about ten minutes before the ship sank, Captain
Smith gave word for every one to look to his own safety. I
sprang to aid the men struggling to launch the liferaft and we
had succeeded in getting it to the edge of the boat when a giant
wave carried it away.</p>

<p>“I went with it and found myself underneath. Struggling
through an eternity, I finally emerged and was swimming one
hundred and fifty feet from the Titanic when she went down. I
felt no suction as the vessel plunged.</p>

<p>“I did not see Mr. Ismay at all. Captain Smith stuck to the
bridge and, turning, I saw him jump just as the vessel glided
into the depths. He had not donned a life belt, so far as I could
see, and went down with the ship.”</p>

<p>The witness showed so plainly the mental and physical
strain under which he was laboring that both Senators Newlands<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_252">{252}</a></span>
and Reed urged Senator Smith to excuse him. After a few more
interrogations Senator Smith did so.</p>

<p>“I regret extremely having had to subject you to such an
ordeal,” he said, addressing Bride, “because of your condition. I
would have avoided it, if possible, but the committee thanks you
most heartily for the forbearance you have shown and the frankness
of your testimony.”</p>

<p>Senator Smith then called what he evidently expected to
be one of the most important witnesses, Harold S. Bride, the
sole surviving wireless operator of the Titanic.</p>

<p>Crippled as a result of his experiences, he was wheeled in
an invalid’s chair to the table where the committee sat.</p>

<p>“Contrary to the usual procedure,” said Senator Smith, rising
in his place, “I must place you under oath. Raise your right
hand.”</p>

<h3>SENATE REPEATS THE OATH.</h3>

<p>The witness, hand uplifted, listened while the Senator repeated
the oath. Then he bowed in assent. Bride said he was
a native of London, was 22 years old and had learned his profession
in a British school of telegraphy.</p>

<p>“What practical experience have you had?” asked Senator
Smith.</p>

<p>“I have crossed to the States three times and to Brazil
twice,” said Bride.</p>

<p>Bride remembered receiving and sending messages relative
to the speed of the Titanic on its trial tests. After leaving Southampton
on the Titanic’s fatal trip he could not remember receiving
or sending any messages for Ismay. Senator Smith asked
particularly about messages on Sunday.</p>

<p>“I don’t remember, sir,” said Bride. “There was so much
business Sunday.”</p>

<p>He was asked if Captain Smith received or sent any messages
Sunday.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“How do you know he did not?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_253">{253}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Because I see the messages Mr. Phillips takes when they are
made up.”</p>

<p>“Were those for Sunday made up?”</p>

<p>“No, they never were.”</p>

<p>After testifying he made no permanent record of the iceberg
warnings, Bride insisted he gave the memorandum of the warning
to the officer on the watch. The name of the officer he could
not tell.</p>

<p>“I know the officers by sight but not by name,” he said. He
did not inform Captain Smith.</p>

<p>Bride said he was in bed when the impact came. He was
not alarmed at the collision and remained in bed about ten minutes.
He saw Phillips in the operating room.</p>

<p>“He told me he thought the boat had been injured in some
way and he expected it would have to go back to the builders,”
said Bride.</p>

<h3>BETTER SEND OUT A CALL FOR ASSISTANCE.</h3>

<p>The witness said that according to arrangement he relieved
Phillips. “Immediately the captain came in and said we had better
send out a call for assistance,” testified Bride. “Phillips asked
if he wanted to send a distress call. The captain said he did. I
could read what Phillips sent&mdash;C. Q. D.”</p>

<p>“How soon did he get a reply?”</p>

<p>“As far as I know, immediately. I could not hear what he
received, however.”</p>

<p>The witness told of having intercepted a message from the
Californian intended for the Baltic, which told of the presence of
three huge icebergs in the vicinity of the former vessel.</p>

<p>“I gave the message to the captain personally,” he said.</p>

<p>Bride did not take down the message and could not give its
precise form. “The Californian was seeking out the Baltic, and
I merely noted that it was an ice report and told the captain,”
he said.</p>

<p>Under a fire of questions Bride acknowledged that a half
hour previously, or at 4.30 Sunday afternoon, he was working on<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_254">{254}</a></span>
his accounts in the wireless room when he heard the Californian
trying to raise the Titanic. He did not respond, he said, because,
he was “busy.”</p>

<p>“You had the telephone apparatus at your ear?” inquired
Senator Smith, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And you did not respond to the call?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then a half hour later on, about five hours before the disaster,
you took the message when it was intended for another
vessel, the Baltic?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>In an effort to determine whether the signal “C. Q. D.”
might not have been misunderstood by passing ships Senator
Smith called upon Mr. Marconi.</p>

<h3>MEANING OF DIFFERENT CALLS.</h3>

<p>“The C. Q.,” said Mr. Marconi, “is an international signal
which meant that all stations should cease sending except the
one using the call. The ‘D’ was added to indicate danger. The
call, however, now has been superseded by the universal call, ‘S.
O. S’.”</p>

<p>Senator Smith then resumed the direct examination of Bride,
who has said the North German Lloyd was the first to answer the
Titanic’s distress signal.</p>

<p>“Have you heard it said that the Frankfurt was the ship
nearest to the Titanic?” the senator asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; Mr. Phillips told me that.”</p>

<p>“How did he know?”</p>

<p>“By the strength of the signals,” said the witness, who added
that the Carpathia answered shortly after.</p>

<p>The witness said that twenty minutes later the Frankfurt
operator interrupted to ask “what was the matter?”</p>

<p>“What did you reply?” the senator inquired.</p>

<p>“Mr. Phillips said he was a fool and told him to keep out.”</p>

<p>There was no further effort to get the Frankfurt’s position.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_255">{255}</a></span></p>

<p>Time after time Senator Smith asked in varying forms why
the Titanic did not explain in detail its condition to the Frankfurt.</p>

<p>“Any operator receiving C. Q. D. and the position of the
ship, if he is on the job,” said Bride, “would tell the captain at
once.”</p>

<p>“Ask him if it would have taken longer to have sent ‘You
are a fool, keep out,’ than ‘we are sinking?’<span class="lftspc">”</span> suggested Senator
Reed.</p>

<p>“Was your object in dismissing the somewhat tardy inquiry
of the Frankfurt due to your desire to hang on to a certainty, the
Carpathia?” inquired Senator Smith.</p>

<p>The witness said it was. “But under the circumstances could
you not with propriety send a detailed message to the Frankfurt?”
Senator Smith insisted.</p>

<p>“I did not think we could under the circumstances.”</p>

<h3>BRIDE INTERROGATED.</h3>

<p>“Would you still make the same reply if you were told that
the Frankfurt was twenty miles nearer to you than the Carpathia?”</p>

<p>Bride replied that the Carpathia was then on its way with
its lifeboats ready.</p>

<p>Mr. Marconi testified to the distress signals and said the
Frankfurt was equipped with Marconi wireless. He said the
receipts of the signals C. Q. D. by the Frankfurt’s operator should
have been all sufficient to send the Frankfurt to the immediate
rescue.</p>

<p>Under questioning by Senator Smith Bride said that undoubtedly
the Frankfurt received all of the urgent appeals for
help sent subsequently to the Carpathia.</p>

<p>“Why did you not send the messages to the Frankfurt as well
as to the Carpathia?” asked Senator Smith.</p>

<p>“He would not have understood.”</p>

<p>The witness said that before leaving the cabin ten minutes
before the ship went down Phillips sent out a final C. Q. D.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_256">{256}</a></span>
There was no response, Bride saying the spark was then so weak
that it probably did not carry.</p>

<p>When Bride and Phillips stepped out on the beatdeck he
said they found persons rushing around in confusion. They were
seeking life belts.</p>

<p>“There were no big lifeboats aboard at that time,” said Bride.
“There was a life raft over the officers quarters, which later was
lost over the side.”</p>

<p>The witness then told of his experience in following with a
small boat beneath which he nearly was drowned before he could
extricate himself. With a number of other survivors he clambored
on the overturned boat.</p>

<p>“One of these was Phillips,” said the witness. “He died on
the way to the Carpathia and was buried later at sea.”</p>

<p>When Bride gained the bottom of the boat he found between
35 and 40 men already there.</p>

<h3>THE LAST MAN ABOARD.</h3>

<p>“I was the last man invited aboard,” said Bride.</p>

<p>“Did any others seek to get on?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, dozens. We couldn’t take them.”</p>

<p>The witness said he did not see J. Bruce Ismay, and that the
last he saw of Captain Smith he was in the act of jumping from
the bridge just as the ship went down. He said he was swimming
within 150 feet of the ship when it went down and that he felt
no suction.</p>

<p>Long before the hearing was resumed in the afternoon
crowds besieged the Waldorf-Astoria rooms, but few who had
not been sought by the committee were admitted.</p>

<p>C. P. Neil, commissioner of labor of the Department of Commerce
and Labor, and Representatives Levy and Livingston, of
New York, were among the visitors.</p>

<p>Senators Smith and Newlands conferred after luncheon for
more than an hour, and it was nearly 4 o’clock when they reached
the committee room.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Bride, the operator of the Titanic, here?” Senator<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_257">{257}</a></span>
Smith asked of Mr. Marconi and Mr. Sammis, of the Marconi
Company.</p>

<p>They told him that Mr. Bride had been sent to a physician,
but could be brought back later. The senator said he wanted to
ask the operator several additional questions, but could postpone
them.</p>

<p>The second officer of the Titanic, C. H. Lightoller, was called
by Senator Smith, but was not present, and the third officer of the
Titanic, Herbert John Pittman, took the stand.</p>

<p>“Do you know of your own knowledge whether the Titanic’s
ship’s log was preserved or taken from the Titanic?” asked
Senator Smith.</p>

<p>“I do not.”</p>

<p>After the hearing adjourned Senator Smith made a statement
to the press in which he explained the intentions of the
committee. He said:</p>

<p>“The object of the committee in coming to New York coincidental
with the arrival of the Carpathia was prompted by the
desire to avail itself of first-hand information from the active
participants in this sad affair. Our course has been guided solely
by this purpose&mdash;to obtain accurate information without delay.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_258">{258}</a></span>”</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br><br>
THE FUNERAL SHIP AND ITS DEAD.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">116 Buried at Sea&mdash;Nearly All Sailors&mdash;No Prominent Men
Buried&mdash;No Bullet Wounds Found&mdash;Halifax’s Bells Toll
For Dead&mdash;Astor’s Body Identified&mdash;Death Ship’s Voyage&mdash;The
Captain’s Story&mdash;Canon Hind’s Narrative.</p></div>

<p>The cable ship Mackay-Bennett which had been sent out
to recover as many as possible of the Titanic’s dead, reached
her pier in the dockyard at Halifax, Nova Scotia, the nearest
port, at 9.30 on the morning of April 30, almost exactly two
weeks after the disaster.</p>

<p>Down the gangway to the pier in the sunlight of a perfect
April day they carried 190 of those who had started forth on the
maiden voyage of the biggest ship afloat.</p>

<p>In her quest the Mackay-Bennett had found 306 of the
Titanic’s dead, but only 190 were brought to shore. The rest,
the 116, were buried at sea. And 57 of those 116 were among the
identified dead.</p>

<p>Of those who were brought to shore, 60 lay unnamed at the
curling rink on the edge of the town. It was believed that the
60 were all members of the Titanic’s crew, but the slender hope
that their own dead might be among them sent many to the rink.</p>

<p>One of the sixty was a little baby girl. Five of them were
women, but none of the women that were found were from the
first cabin passengers. There was no hope that the body of Mrs.
Straus was among them. There was practically no hope that
Major Butt was among the unnamed sixty. The quest of the
Mackay-Bennett bore greater results than were anticipated, and
Capt. Lardner believed that his ship recovered about all of those
who did not go down in the Titanic.</p>

<p>The search was continued over five days, sometimes with<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_259">{259}</a></span>
the ship drifting without success amid miles and miles of wreckage,
tables, chairs, doors, pillows, scattered fragments of the
luxury that was the White Star liner Titanic.</p>

<p>At other times the bodies were found close together, and
once they saw more than a hundred that looked to the wondering
crew of the Mackay-Bennett like a flock of sea gulls in the
fog, so strangely did the ends of the life belts rise and fall with
the rise and fall of the waves.</p>

<p>Those whose dead the Mackay-Bennett brought to shore
came forward with their claims, and from the middle of the afternoon
the rest of the day was filled with the steps of identification
and the signing of many papers.</p>

<p>The first to be claimed was John Jacob Astor and for his
death was issued the first “accidental drowning” death certificate
of the hundreds who lost their lives in the wreck of the Titanic.</p>

<p>Vincent Astor and Nicholas Biddle started for New York
with the body the next night.</p>

<h3>THE BODY OF ISADORE STRAUS IDENTIFIED.</h3>

<p>The second identified was Isidor Straus. The start for New
York was made early the next morning. Three went on the
same night. These were George E. Graham, Milton C. Long, and
C. C. Jones. Lawrence Millett has identified his father.</p>

<p>Friends quickly took charge of the bodies of E. H. Kent, W.
D. Douglass, Timothy McCarty, George Rosenshine, E. C. Ostby,
E. G. Crosby, William C. Porter, A. O. Holverson, Emil
Brandies, Thomas McCafferty, Wykoff Vanderhoef, and A. S.
Nicholson.</p>

<p>Sharp and distinct in all the tidings the Mackay-Bennett
brought to shore the fact stands out that fifty-seven of those
who were identified on board were recommitted to the sea. Of
the 190 identified dead that were recovered from the scene of
the Titanic wreck only 130 were brought to Halifax.</p>

<p>This news, which was given out almost immediately after
the death ship reached her pier, was a confirmation of the sus<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_260">{260}</a></span>picion
that in the last few days had seized upon the colony of
those waiting here to claim their dead.</p>

<p>Yet it came as a deep, a stirring surprise. It stunned the
White Star men who have had to direct the work from Halifax.</p>

<p>They had been confidently posting the names of the recovered
as the wireless brought the news in from the Atlantic.
When the suspicion arose that some of the identified might have
been buried at sea the White Star people said that they did not
know, but they were working on the assumption that Capt.
Lardner would bring them all to port, and that only the unidentifiable
had been recommitted to the sea.</p>

<h3>THE UNNAMED DEAD.</h3>

<p>Then they learned that the Mackay-Bennett had brought in
sixty unidentified. The hallway of the curling rink where the
dead were removed from the cable ship was thronged all afternoon
with friends and relatives eager beyond expression to see
those unnamed dead, but the attention of the embalmers was
turned to those already identified, for whom the claimants were
waiting. For the most part the unidentified could not be viewed
until the next morning.</p>

<p>One of them was thought to be Arthur White, a member
of the Titanic’s crew.</p>

<p>The suspense was acute. Yet those who were most anxious
for the morrow to come knew that hope was of the slenderest.
They knew that the nameless sixty were almost all members
of the crew. Capt. Lardner said that he was sure of it. He
knew it by the clothes they wore.</p>

<p>As to the fifty-seven identified dead that were buried at sea,
the whole colony was stirred by pity that it had to be, and not a
few wonder if it really had to be, a wonder fed by the talk of some
of the embalmers. Yet few were immediately concerned, most
of those in Halifax were waiting for men who sailed first cabin
of the Titanic. It appears that only one of these was among the
ones who were buried at sea. This was Frederick Sutton, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_261">{261}</a></span>
Philadelphia. The large majority were either members of the
Titanic’s crew or steerage passengers.</p>

<p>Of the 116 that Capt. Lardner thought best to return to the
sea, he explained that the unidentified seemed unidentifiable,
that the identified were too mutilated to bring to shore.</p>

<p>“Let me say first of all,” he announced when the reporters
gathered around him, “that I was commissioned to bring aboard
all the bodies found floating, but owing to the unanticipated
number of bodies found, owing to the bad weather and other
conditions it was impossible to carry out instructions, so some
were committed to the deep after service, conducted by Canon
Hind.”</p>

<p>Capt. Lardner explained that neither he nor any of his people
had dreamed that so many of the Titanic’s dead would be
found floating on the surface of the Atlantic.</p>

<h3>ONLY 106 BODIES PRESERVED.</h3>

<p>It was more than his embalmer could handle, for, although
the material for embalming seventy bodies, which was all that
Halifax sent out with the Mackay-Bennett, was supplemented
at sea by materials borrowed from the Minia, the number of dead
so preserved for the return to shore was only 106.</p>

<p>He did not know how long he would have to stay at his
grim work on the scene of the wreck. He did not know how long
bad weather would impede the homeward voyage.</p>

<p>He did not know how long he could safely carry the multitude
of dead. It seemed best to recommit some to the sea, and
so on three different days 116 were weighted down and dropped
over the edge of the ship into the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Then rose the question as to why some were picked for burial
at sea and others left on board to be brought home to the waiting
families on shore. The reporters put the question to the
Captain, and he answered it:</p>

<p>“No prominent man was recommitted to the deep. It seemed
best to embalm as quickly as possible in those cases where
large property might be involved. It seemed best to be sure to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_262">{262}</a></span>
bring back to land the dead where the death might give rise to
such questions as large insurance and inheritance and all the
litigation.</p>

<p>“Most of those who were buried out there were members of
the Titanic’s crew. The man who lives by the sea ought to be
satisfied to be buried at sea. I think it is the best place. For my
own part I should be contented to be committed to the deep.”</p>

<p>To emphasize the uncertainty of the task he directed, Capt.
Lardner pointed silently to the forward hold, where an hour before
those on the pier had seen the dead lying side by side on the
floor, each in the wrapping of tarpaulin.</p>

<p>“They were ready for burial,” the Captain said. “We had
the weights in them, for we didn’t know when we should have to
give them up.”</p>

<h3>A FEW MORE BODIES RECOVERED.</h3>

<p>To those who hoped to find their own among the unidentified
in the curling ring to-morrow Capt. Lardner held out little
encouragement except the prospect that the quest of the Minia
may result in a few more bodies being recovered. He believed
that his own ship gathered in most of those who were kept afloat
by the lifebelts.</p>

<p>Almost all of the rest, in his opinion, went down with the
rush of waters that closed over the Titanic, driving them down
in the hatchways and holding the dead imprisoned in the great
wreck.</p>

<p>Survivors told of many pistol shots heard in those dark
moments when the last lifeboats were putting off, and though the
pier on the night the Carpathia landed was astir with rumors of
men shot down as they fought to save their lives, not one of the
bodies that were recovered yesterday had any pistol shots, according
to Capt. Lardner and the members of his crew.</p>

<p>The mutilations which marked so many were broken arms
and legs and crushed skulls, where the living on the Titanic were
swept against the stanchions by the onrush of the sea.</p>

<p>The little repair shop on the Mackay-Bennett was a treasure<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_263">{263}</a></span>
house when she came to port. Fifteen thousand dollars in money
was found on the recovered bodies and jewelry that will be worth
a king’s ransom. One of the crew related his experience with
one dead man whose pockets he turned inside out only to have
seventeen diamonds roll out in every direction upon the littered
deck.</p>

<p>It was a little after 9.30 that the Mackay-Bennett was sighted
by those waiting for her since the break of day. For it was in
the chill of 6 o’clock on a Canadian Spring morning that the people
began to assemble on the pier in the dockyard.</p>

<p>They were undertakers for the most part, mingling with
the newspaper men who hurried to and fro between the water’s
edge and the little bell tent set up a few yards back to guard the
wires that were to flash the news to the ends of the continent.</p>

<h3>WATCH FOR MEN WITH CAMERAS.</h3>

<p>The dockyard was patrolled by twenty members of the crew
and four petty officers from H. M. C. S. Niobe and by a squad of
men from the Dominion police, who were instructed to keep out
all without passes countersigned by the commandant, and who
were particularly vigilant in the watch for men with cameras.</p>

<p>Just as the death ship reached her pier, and in the midst of
the eager movement forward to learn what news she brought
from the scene of the Titanic’s wreck, a little tug was spotted
near by, and Commander Martin, in charge of the dockyard,
scented a moving picture man.</p>

<p>In a very few moments he was putting out for the tug in
the little patrol launch. Again a few moments and he was standing
on the pier with a complacent smile on his face.</p>

<p>“I have the films,” he said in explanation, so the privacy was
guarded.</p>

<p>The friends and relatives of those who were lost when the
great liner went down were urged not to assume the ordeal of
meeting the Mackay-Bennett. Almost without exception they
followed this advice, and only a scattering few could be seen
among those waiting on the pier.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_264">{264}</a></span></p>

<p>In all the crowd of men, officials, undertakers, and newspaper
men, there was just one woman, solitary, spare, clasping
her heavy black shawl tightly around her.</p>

<p>This was Eliza Lurette, for more than thirty years in the
service of Mrs. William August Spencer, who was waiting at her
home on East Eighty-sixth Street, New York, while Miss Lurette
had journeyed to Halifax to seek the body of Mr. Spencer,
who went down with the Titanic.</p>

<p>So the crowd that waited on the pier was made up almost
entirely of men who had impersonal business there, and the air
was full of the chatter of conjecture and preparation.</p>

<p>Then, warned by the tolling of the bells up in the town, a
hush fell upon the waiting people. The gray clouds that had
overcast the sky parted, and the sun shone brilliantly on the rippling
water of the harbor as the Mackay-Bennett drew alongside
her pier.</p>

<h3>THE DEAD LAY EVERYWHERE.</h3>

<p>Capt. Lardner could be seen upon the bridge. The crew
hung over the sides, joyously alive and glad to be home. But in
every part of the ship the dead lay. High on the poop deck
coffins and rough shells were piled and piled.</p>

<p>Dead men in tarpaulins lined the flooring of the cable-wells
both fore and aft, so that there was hardly room for a foot to
be put down. And in the forward hold dead men were piled one
upon another, their eyes closed as in sleep, and over them all a
great tarpaulin was stretched. Those that pressed forward to
see were sickened and turned back.</p>

<p>The business of moment was to discharge that freight, and
this was done with all possible dispatch.</p>

<p>The uncoffined dead were carried down in stretchers, placed
in the rough shells that were piled upon the pier, and one by one
driven up the slope and into the town in the long line of hearses
and black undertaker’s wagons that had been gathered from
every quarter. It was speedily done, but quietly and without irreverent
haste.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_265">{265}</a></span></p>

<p>For two hours this business proceeded before anyone could
go upon the pier and the sounds were like the hum of a small
factory. There were the muffled orders, the shuffling and tramping
of feet, the scraping as of packing boxes drawn across the
rough flooring and the eternal hammering that echoed all along
the coal sheds.</p>

<p>Two hours it was before any one could go on board, and
then came another hour when the coffins were swung down from
the deck and piled up on the wharf ready for the removal that
took until well into the middle of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Few of the relatives were allowed to pass beyond the cordon
that stretched all about the pier at which the dead were landed.</p>

<p>One of the first to get through the lines and the first of all
the waiting crowd to make his way aboard after the ship reached
her pier was Capt. Richard Roberts, of the Astor yacht, who was
filled with a great concern at the news that had come from the
Widener party.</p>

<h3>NOT MR. WIDENER.</h3>

<p>For long before the Mackay-Bennett reached her pier it was
established as definitely as it may ever be established that the
man who was picked up at sea for George D. Widener was not
Mr. Widener, but his man-servant Edward Keating.</p>

<p>Although the name was sent in by wireless, a later examination
of the dead man’s clothing and effects proved that it was
Keating’s body. A letter in the pocket was addressed to Widener,
but the coat was labeled “E. K.” and the garments were of
an inferior quality. Identification by features was out of the
question, for the dead man had been struck by some spar or bit
of wreckage, and the face was mutilated past recognition. He
was buried at sea, and the news sent on to the waiting family.</p>

<p>Young Mr. Widener, who had been waiting here for a week
with a private car to carry the body of his father home to Philadelphia,
had heard of the uncertainty, and in a fever of impatience
he met the Mackay-Bennett at Quarantine, went over the effects<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_266">{266}</a></span>
with Captain Lardner, and was satisfied that it was Keating
whose body was found and who was later committed to the deep.</p>

<p>The haunting fear that this same error might have been
made in the case of Colonel Astor had possession of the whole
Astor party and grew acute as the Widener story went out. That
was what sent Captain Roberts hurrying to the ship. He was
admitted and saw for himself. The coffin top was removed on
board.</p>

<p>The plain gold ring with the two little diamonds set deep,
the gold buckle on the belt that Colonel Astor always wore, and
a sum amounting to nearly $3000 in the pockets settled the uncertainty.
Twenty minutes after he had boarded the ship Captain
Roberts was hurrying through the crowd to reach the nearest
telephone that he might speed the news to waiting Vincent
Astor.</p>

<h3>QUESTIONS OF IDENTITY.</h3>

<p>Beyond these two cases the questions of identity were taken
up at the Mayflower Curling Rink at the edge of the town, where
the line of hearses had been trundling since the Mackay-Bennett
landed. As they passed the crowds were hushed, men bowed
their heads, and officers saluted.</p>

<p>At the rink the great main floor was given over to the coffins
and shells containing the identified dead, and as soon as the
embalmers had done their work the friends and relatives came
forward and claimed their own.</p>

<p>Upstairs in the large, bare room the packets of clothing were
distributed in rows upon the floor.</p>

<p>There the oak chests of the Provincial Cashier were opened
for the sorting of the canvas bags that contained the valuables,
the letters and the identifying trinkets of the dead. It was all
very systematic. It was all very much businesslike, and while
a lunch counter served refreshments to the weary workers, and
while the Intercolonial set up a desk for railway tickets, the
Medical Examiner was busy issuing death certificates, and the
Registrar was issuing burial permits, all to the accompanying
click, click of several typewriters.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_267">{267}</a></span></p>

<p>A satisfactory arrangement was reached as to the disposition
of the personal effects. A man would claim his dead, take
the number, make his way to the representatives of the Provincial
Secretary, and there claim the contents of the little canvas
bag by making affidavit that he was the duly authorized representative
of the executor or next of kin.</p>

<p>The little crimson tickets that are the death certificates were
printed for the tragedies of every day in the year. Their formal
points and dimensions seemed hopelessly inadequate for even the
briefest statement of the tragedy of the Titanic.</p>

<h3>CERTIFICATE FOR THE DEAD.</h3>

<p>The first body claimed and removed from the rink was that
of John Jacob Astor. The certificate, the first issued for one
of the Titanic dead, reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Name of deceased&mdash;John Jacob Astor. Sex&mdash;M. Age&mdash;47.
Date of death&mdash;April 15, 1912. Residence, street, etc.&mdash;840
Fifth Av. N. Y. C. Occupation&mdash;Gentleman. Married.
Cause&mdash;Accidental drowning. S. S. Titanic at sea.
Length of illness&mdash;Suddenly. Name of physician in attendance.</p></div>

<p>Such details as these filled the day.</p>

<p>After the greater part of the Titanic’s dead had been shifted
from the Mackay-Bennett to the pier, Captain Lardner descended
to the dining saloon, and with the reporters from all over the
country gathered around the table, he opened the ship’s log and,
slowly tracing his fingers over the terse entries, he told them
the story of the death ship’s voyage.</p>

<p>Lardner is English by birth and accent, and tall and square
of build, with a full brown beard and eyes of unusual keenness.</p>

<p>“We left Halifax,” he began, “shortly after noon on Wednesday,
April 17, but fog and bad weather delayed us on the run
out, and we did not get there till Saturday night at 8 o’clock.</p>

<p>“We asked all ships to report to us if they passed any wreckage
or bodies, and on Saturday at noon we received a communication
from the German mailboat steamship Rhein to the effect<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_268">{268}</a></span>
that in latitude 42.1. N. longitude 49.13, she had passed wreckage
and bodies.</p>

<p>“The course was shaped for that position. Later in the afternoon
we spoke to the German steamship Bremen, and they reported
having passed three large icebergs and some bodies in 42
N. 49.20 W.</p>

<p>“We arrived on the scene at 8 o’clock Saturday evening, and
then we stopped and let the ship drift. It was in the middle of
the watch that some of the wreckage and a few bodies were
sighted.</p>

<p>“At daylight the boats were lowered, and though there was
a heavy sea running at the time, fifty-one bodies were recovered.”</p>

<p>The Rev. Canon K. C. Hinds, rector of All Saints’ Cathedral,
who officiated at the burial of 116 bodies, the greatest number
consigned to the ocean at one time, tells the story of the
Mackay-Bennett’s trip as follows:</p>

<h3>OUR JOURNEY SLOW.</h3>

<p>We left Halifax shortly after noon on April 17, and had not
proceeded far when fog set in so that our journey was slow. We
reached the vicinity of the wreckage on Saturday evening. Early
on Sunday morning the search for bodies began, when the captain
and other officers of the ship kept a lookout from the bridge.</p>

<p>Soon the command was given “Stand by the boat!” and a
little later the lifeboat was lowered and the work begun of picking
up the bodies as they were pointed out in the water to the
crew.</p>

<p>Through the day some fifty were picked up. All were carefully
examined and their effects placed in separate bags, all
bodies and bags being numbered.</p>

<p>It was deemed wise that some of them should be buried. At
8 P. M. the ship’s bell was tolled to indicate all was in readiness
for the service. Standing on the bow of the ship as she rocked to
and fro, one gazed at the starry heavens and across the boundless
deep, and to his mind the psalmist’s words came with mighty
force:<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_269">{269}</a></span></p>

<p>“Whither shall I go then from Thy spirit, or whither shall
I go then from Thy presence? If I ascend up to heaven Thou
art there, I make my bed in the grave, Thou art there also. If I
take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost part
of the sea, even there shall Thy hand lead me, and Thy right
hand shall hold me.”</p>

<p>In the solemn stillness of the early night, the words of that
unequaled burial office rang across the waters: “I am the resurrection
and the life, saith the Lord. He that believeth in Me shall
never die.”</p>

<p>When the time of committal came these words were used
over each body:</p>

<h3>COMMIT HIS BODY TO THE DEEP.</h3>

<p>“Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God to take up to
Himself the soul of our dear brother departed, we, therefore,
commit his body to the deep to be turned to corruption, looking
for the resurrection of the body (when the seas shall give up her
dead) and the life of the world to come, through Jesus Christ
Our Lord, who shall change our vile body, that it may be like
unto His glorious body, according to the mighty working whereby
He is able to subdue all things to Himself.”</p>

<p>The prayers from the burial service were said, the hymn
“Jesus, Lover of My Soul,” sung and the blessing given.</p>

<p>Any one attending a burial at sea will most surely lose the
common impression of the awfulness of a grave in the mighty
deep. The wild Atlantic may rage and toss, the shipwrecked
mariners cry for mercy, but far below in the calm untroubled
depth they rest in peace.</p>

<p>On Monday the work began again early in the morning, and
another day was spent in searching and picking up the floating
bodies and at night a number were buried. On Tuesday the work
was still the same until the afternoon, when the fog set in, and
continued all day Wednesday.</p>

<p>Wednesday was partly spent in examining bodies, and at
noon a number were committed to the deep. Thursday came in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_270">{270}</a></span>
fine and from early morning until evening the work went on.</p>

<p>During the day word came that the cable ship Minia was on
her way to help and would be near us at midnight.</p>

<p>“Early on Friday some more bodies were picked up. The
captain then felt we had covered the ground fairly well and decided
to start on our homeward way at noon. After receiving
some supplies from the Minia we bid good-bye and proceeded on
our way.</p>

<p>“The Mackay-Bennett succeeded in finding 306 bodies, of
which 116 were buried at sea, and one could not help feeling, as
we steamed homeward, that of those bodies we had on board it
would be well if the greater number of them were resting in the
deep.</p>

<p>“It is to be noted how earnestly and reverently all the work
was done and how nobly the crew acquitted themselves during a
work of several days which meant a hard and trying strain on
mind and body.</p>

<p>“What seems a very regrettable fact is that in chartering the
Mackay-Bennett for this work the White Star Company did not
send an official agent to accompany the steamer in her search for
the bodies.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_271">{271}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br><br>
INQUIRY BY UNITED STATES SENATE.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">Loading at the Rail&mdash;Inadequate Life-saving Appliances&mdash;No Extra
Lookout&mdash;Searchlights Blinding&mdash;Wireless Rivals Not All
Aroused&mdash;Went to Death in Sleep&mdash;Scratch Seamen&mdash;Cries
of Agony&mdash;A Pitiful Story&mdash;Senators Ascertain Pertinent
Facts&mdash;Much Good Accomplished.</p></div>

<p>What has been accomplished by the Senatorial inquiry into the
loss of the Titanic with sixteen hundred lives?</p>

<p>For more than a week of the two that have elapsed since the Titanic
made a record on her maiden voyage&mdash;a record never paralleled
in marine history for its horrors, its sacrifice of life and material
property&mdash;an earnest body of United States Senators has been at
work conscientiously striving to uncover the facts, not alone for the
purpose of placing the responsibility for what has now become one
of the most heart-rending chapters of all ocean history, but also in
the hope of framing remedial legislation looking to the prevention of
its recurrence.</p>

<p>To attempt to draw conclusions as to the value of the work of
a committee which is yet upon the threshold of its task would be presumptuous,
but it is not too soon to present and formulate some of
the pertinent facts which its researches have established in the light
of sworn evidence.</p>

<p>Any attempt at systematic analysis of the facts deduced from
the many thousand of pages of testimony already taken naturally divided
itself into two departments:</p>

<p>Were the Titanic’s equipment and her general state of preparedness
such as to justify the broad claims made in her behalf before
the crisis arose, that she represented the acme of human possibility
not only in ocean going comfort and speed but also in safety
at sea?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_272">{272}</a></span></p>

<p>Were the personnel and discipline of her officers and crew of
such a standard that, after the supreme crisis confronted them, they
utilized to the best advantage such facilities for the safeguarding
and preservation of life as remained at their disposal?</p>

<p>With ten thousand families on both sides of the Atlantic mourning
the untimely death of relatives and friends who went down
into the depths from the decks of a brand new ship, widely proclaimed
the greatest and the safest that ever ploughed the sea, these
are, after all, the most pertinent questions that may be asked by a
sorrowing world as it looks to the future rather than the past.</p>

<h3>LIFE-SAVING APPARATUS INADEQUATE.</h3>

<p>It has been demonstrated&mdash;and frankly conceded by the company’s
managers and officers in the light of after knowledge&mdash;that
the Titanic’s life-saving appliances were woefully inadequate to the
safeguarding of even one-half her complement of passengers and
crew. On the day after the disaster was known to the world it was
shown that the ship’s equipment of lifeboats complied with the requirements
of the English Board of Trade, but that those requirements
were so obsolete and antiquated that they dated back to 1898
and were drafted to provide for vessels of less than one-quarter
the gross tonnage of the mammoth craft of 46,000 tons of displacement.</p>

<p>The Titanic carried on her boat deck&mdash;sometimes referred to
as her sun deck&mdash;fourteen of the largest regulation size lifeboats,
seven on her port side and seven on the starboard. Each of these
had a carrying capacity, according to the Board of Trade’s established
method of computation, of 65.5 persons. Their aggregate
capacity when afloat, therefore, was 917. The ship carried, in addition,
four of the so-called collapsible boats and two others known as
emergency boats-comparatively small craft employed in occasional
duty&mdash;as when a man falls overboard.</p>

<p>The combined capacity of these six when afloat was hardly more
than sufficient to care for two hundred persons. At the most liberal
estimate, therefore, the entire equipment of boats aboard the great
White Star liner might have afforded refuge, in the most favorable<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_273">{273}</a></span>
conditions, to less than 1,200 persons, or not quite half the number
actually aboard the ship, on her maiden voyage.</p>

<p>In stating the lifeboat capacity the term “when afloat” has been
used advisedly. One of the points which each of the Titanic’s surviving
officers has emphasized in evidence is the vast difference between
loading with its human freight a boat that has been already
placed in the water and loading one “at the rail,” from a deck seventy
feet above the water, with the subsequent perils of lowering it
by means of the tackles sustaining its weight from bow and stern.
Several of the officers have said that, in lowering loaded boats from
the rail of the Titanic’s boat deck, they would consider it unwise and
even dangerous to fill the boats to more than one-half their rated capacity.</p>

<p>All the lifeboats that went away from the Titanic were loaded
and lowered from the rail. Some of the smaller collapsible and
emergency boats did not get away at all until the ship was so low
in the water that they were simply pushed overboard, and one of
them went over bottom up.</p>

<h3>BOAT CARRIES 58 PERSONS.</h3>

<p>Harold G. Lowe, the fifth officer, commanded a boat which
carried fifty-eight persons aboard. This, so far as is known, is the
largest number of passengers carried in any of the lifeboats. Mr.
Lowe testified that as his craft was lowered away from the davits
he feared momentarily that, as a result of the tremendous strain
upon her structure, she would buckle amidships and break before
she reached the sustaining surface of the water, dropping all into
the sea. “Had one more person leaped aboard her amidships as she
was going down past the other decks,” he said, “it might well have
proved to be the last straw.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lowe feared this might happen, as he saw steerage passengers
“glaring at the boat” as it was lowered past the decks whereon
they stood. It was for that reason, he explained to the investigating
committee, that he discharged his revolver three times into the air as
he and his boatload were dropping past the three lower decks. His
purpose, he said, was to show that he was armed and to prevent any<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_274">{274}</a></span>
effort to overload the craft beyond a point which he already considered
perilous.</p>

<p>C. H. Lightoller, second officer and ranking surviving officer of
the Titanic, expressed the opinion that, in filling lifeboats from the
Titanic’s boat deck, “at the rail,” it was involving serious risk to load
them to more than half their rated capacity for filling while afloat.
H. G. Boxhall, fourth officer, expressed a like view, but added that
in an extreme emergency one man might take more chances than
another.</p>

<p>In view of these expert opinions, it will be seen that, when it
came to loading the Titanic’s passengers into lifeboats “from the
rail,” the actual life-saving capacity of her available equipment was
far less than the one thousand or eleven hundred that might have
been carefully packed away into boats already resting safely on the
surface of a calm sea.</p>

<h3>A PUZZLING QUERY.</h3>

<p>And this consideration naturally suggests the query, Why were
the Titanic’s lifeboats all loaded “from the rail” of the topmost deck,
at a point fully seventy feet above the sea? Why were they not
lowered empty, or with only the necessary officers or crew aboard,
and then filled with their quota of passengers, either from some
lower deck, or else after they had reached the sustaining surface of
the water?</p>

<p>It is evident that course was contemplated. Three of the surviving
officers have testified that the available force of seamen was
depleted after the ship struck, because a detail of men had been sent
below to open up the gangway doors, for the purpose of embarking
the passengers into the lifeboats from those outlets. There is nothing
in evidence as yet to show that this purpose was ever accomplished,
or to reveal the fate of the men sent to do the work.</p>

<p>Whether the men were unable or incompetent to force open the
gangway doors, from which the lowered boats might easily have
been filled, as the sea was as smooth as a mill pond; whether these
outlets were jammed as a result of collision with the berg, or stuck<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_275">{275}</a></span>
because the ship’s mechanisms were new, has not been revealed and
may never be known.</p>

<p>Certain it is that all the lifeboats were loaded “from the rail,”
and their safe capacity was thereby reduced one-half in the judgment
of the officers to whom their command was entrusted.</p>

<p>The inadequacy of the Titanic’s lifeboat appliances is not disputed.
Steamship companies are already vying with one another to
correct in this respect the admitted shortcomings of the past. The
sole excuse offered is that collision bulkheads, watertight compartments
and other like devices have been regarded until now as making
the marvelous vessels of the present day “their own best lifeboats.”
The Titanic and many of her sister ships of the ocean
fleets have been called “unsinkable.” They were generally believed
to be so, and it is only since this greatest of disasters has shattered
many illusions that marine engineers have confessed ruefully that
the unsinkable ship has never yet been launched.</p>

<h3>PERILS MINIMIZED.</h3>

<p>Since the day of the watertight compartment and of the wireless
telegraph sea perils have been so minimized that in the most
extreme of likely emergencies the function of the lifeboat had come
to be regarded as that of an ocean ferry capable of transferring passengers
safely and leisurely from an imperilled vessel to another
standing by and co-operating in the task.</p>

<p>That was all the lifeboat had to do when the Republic sank.
That was all they had to do years ago, when the Missouri, under
Captain Hamilton Murrell’s expert management, took off a thousand
persons from a foundering ship without the loss of a single life. So
it had come to be believed that the lifeboats would never be called
upon to do more than that, and least of all in the case of the Titanic,
latest and most superb of all the vessels built by man since the world
began.</p>

<p>So deep rooted was this conviction in the minds of seagoing
men that when Senator Smith, of Michigan, chairman of the investigating
committee, asked one of the surviving officers: “What was
the purpose of the Titanic carrying her fourteen full-size lifeboats?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_276">{276}</a></span>”
he naively replied; “To comply, I suppose, with the regulations of
the London Board of Trade.”</p>

<p>There has been no evidence to indicate that the Titanic lacked
the proper number of life jackets, or life belts&mdash;one for every person
aboard the ship&mdash;and it has not been proven that these life belts
were not new and of proper quality and strength. Major Peuchen,
of Toronto, one of the surviving passengers, however, in the course
of his testimony, made two significant comments. He said that
when the Carpathia, on the morning after the disaster, steamed
through a lot of the Titanic’s floating wreckage, he was surprised
to note great quantities of broken bits of cork, such as are used in
life preservers. He was astonished also that he did not see a larger
number of floating bodies.</p>

<p>“I have always supposed,” said Major Peuchen, who is an experienced
yachtsman, “that a life preserver in good condition would
sustain a dead body as well as a live one.”</p>

<h3>STEAMING AT 21 KNOTS.</h3>

<p>It has been demonstrated by ample evidence that at the time
the Titanic hit the iceberg she was steaming at the undiminished
speed of twenty-one knots an hour into a zone littered with icebergs
and floating ice fields, warning of which her officers had received
hours before by wireless from several other ships, including the
Amerika, of the Hamburg-American Line. When day broke on
Monday, according to Mr. Lane, at least twenty icebergs surrounded
the Carpathia, the largest of which was 150 feet high. They were
within a six-mile radius.</p>

<p>In the chart room, tucked into the corner of a frame above
the table where the navigating officers of the Titanic did their
mathematical work, was a written memorandum of the latitude and
longitude wherein two large icebergs had been reported directly in
the track. Mr. Boxhall had worked out this position under Captain
Smith’s instructions. Mr. Lightoller, the second officer, was familiar
with it, and when his watch ended at 10 o’clock Sunday night
and he surrendered the post on the bridge to the first officer, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_277">{277}</a></span>
Murdock, the remark was made that they would probably “be getting
up into the ice during Mr. Murdock’s watch.”</p>

<p>Despite all this the Titanic was rushing on, driving at railroad
speed toward the port of New York and “a record for a maiden
voyage.”</p>

<p>It was a cloudless and starlit night with no sea running. No
extra lookout was posted in the “ship’s eyes,” the most advanced
position on the vessel’s deck. Up in the crow’s nest Fleet and Lee,
both experienced lookouts, were keeping a sharp watch forward.
They had been duly warned of ice by the pair of lookouts whom they
had relieved.</p>

<h3>UNAIDED BY SEA GLASSES.</h3>

<p>But the men in the crow’s nest had to depend entirely upon the
vision of the naked eye. They had no glass to aid them. Fleet had
occupied a similar post of responsibility four years on the Oceanic
without mishap. His testimony before the committee was that he
never before had been without the aid of a glass. He had a pair of
binoculars when the ship made her trial trip from Belfast, but they
had been mislaid, and when the Titanic steamed out from Southampton
he asked Mr. Lightoller for another pair and was told that there
was no glass for him. Fleet’s warning was too late to prevent the
impact. His testimony was that with a glass he would have reported
the berg in time to have prevented the ship striking it.</p>

<p>When Quartermaster Hitchens came on watch at 10 o’clock
the weather had grown so cold that he, experienced seaman that he
was, immediately thought of icebergs, though it was no part of his
duty to look out for them. The thermometer showed thirty-one
degrees, and the first orders he received were to notify the ship’s
carpenter to look to his fresh-water supply because of the freezing
weather, and to turn on the steam-heating apparatus in the officers’
quarters.</p>

<p>Still no extra lookout was placed and the men in the crow’s
nest were straining their tired eyes ahead without the help of a lens.</p>

<p>Captain Arthur Rostrom, of the Carpathia, testified that when
he was rushing his ship to the aid of the stricken Titanic, taking
un<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_278">{278}</a></span>usual chances because he knew lives were at stake, he placed a double
watch on duty.</p>

<p>Each of the surviving officers, when he was questioned as to
the Titanic’s speed at a time when the proximity of dangerous ice
was definitely reported and clearly indicated by the drop in temperature,
said that it was “not customary” to slacken speed at such
times, provided the weather was clear. The custom is, they said,
“to go ahead and depend upon the lookouts in the crow’s nest and
the watch on the bridge to ‘pick up’ the ice in time to avoid hitting it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lowe, the fifth officer, who was crossing the Atlantic for
the first time in his life, most of his fourteen years’ experience at
sea having been in the southern and eastern oceans, yawned wearily
in the face of the examiner as he admitted that he had never heard
that icebergs were common off the Banks of Newfoundland and that
the fact would not have interested him if he had. He did not know
that the Titanic was following what is known as “the southern
track,” and when he was asked, ventured the guess that she was on
the northerly one.</p>

<h3>MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAVED BY SEARCHLIGHT.</h3>

<p>Questions framed by Senator Smith several times have suggested
that the use of a searchlight might have saved the Titanic.
War ships of all nations make the searchlight a part of their regular
equipment, as is well known. The Titanic’s surviving officers
agreed that it has not been commonly used by vessels of the merchant
marine. Some of them conceded that in the conditions surrounding
the Titanic its use on a clear night might have revealed
the iceberg in time to have saved the ship. Major Peuchen, of Toronto,
said emphatically that it would have done so.</p>

<p>Mr. Lightoller, however, pointed out that, while the searchlight
is often a useful device for those who stand behind it, its rays invariably
blind those upon whom they are trained. Should the use
of searchlights become general upon merchant vessels, he thought,
it would be a matter for careful consideration, experiment and regulation.</p>

<p>The Senatorial inquiry has indicated that the single lifeboat<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_279">{279}</a></span>
drill upon the Titanic had been a rather perfunctory performance;
there had been neither a boat drill nor a fire drill from the time
the great ship left Southampton until she struck the iceberg. While
she lay in harbor before starting on her maiden voyage, and with
her port side against the company pier, two of her lifeboats had been
lowered away from her starboard side, manned by a junior or a warrant
officer and a crew of four men each, who rowed them around
a few minutes and then returned to the ship.</p>

<p>There had also been an inspection in the home port to see
whether the lifeboats contained all the gear specified by the Board
of Trade regulations and Officer Boxhall testified that they did.
Yet, when the emergency came, many of the boats were found to
contain no lights, while others lacked extra oars, biscuits and other
specified requisites.</p>

<h3>UTILITY OF WATER-TIGHT COMPARTMENTS DOUBTED.</h3>

<p>The Titanic’s loss has completely exploded the fallacy that watertight
compartments, of which the big ship had fifteen in her main
divisions, can save a vessel from foundering after having sustained
a raking blow, tearing and ripping out her plates from thirty feet
aft of the bow almost to midships.</p>

<p>Mr. Lightoller expressed the belief under oath that the starboard
side of the Titanic had been pierced through compartments
1, 2, 3 and probably 4, numbering from the collision bulkhead toward
the midship section. The testimony of Quartermaster Hitchins
showed that the vessel filled so fast that when the captain looked at
the commutator five minutes after the ship struck, the Titanic
showed a list of five degrees to starboard. Rushing water drove
the clerks out of the mail room before they could save their letter
bags.</p>

<p>One reform that is likely to take shape early as a result of the
Senatorial investigation is a more thorough regulation of wireless
telegraphy both in shore stations and on ships at sea. Interference
by irresponsible operators will probably be checked by governmental
action, and the whole subject may come up for uniform international
regulation in the Berlin conference.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_280">{280}</a></span></p>

<p>It is conceded that on all ships the receiving apparatus of the
wireless instruments should be manned at all hours of the day and
night, just as are the ship’s bridge and the engine rooms. The Senate
inquiry has showed that had the death call of the Titanic gone
out five minutes later it would never have reached the Carpathia,
whose one wireless operator was about to retire for the night when
he heard the signal that took the Cunarder to the rescue of the seven
hundred who survived.</p>

<p>There has been shown, too, grave need of some cure for the
jealousies and rivalries between competing systems of wireless. To
the Frankfurt, which was one of the nearest, if not the nearest, of
the several ships to the sinking Titanic, her operator sent the curt
message, “Shut up!” From the Californian the operator refused
to take a message, which proved to be an ice warning, because “he
was busy with his accounts.” With the sanction of high officers of
their company wireless operators have suppressed vital public information
for the purpose of commercializing their exclusive knowledge
for personal profit.</p>

<p>So much for the Titanic’s boasted equipment&mdash;or the lack of it.
There remains to be summarized the evidence adduced as to the personnel
and discipline, as these were indicated by what occurred after
the ship confronted the direst of all emergencies.</p>

<p>The Titanic was expected to make a record on her maiden voyage.
She made one unapproached in ocean annals; one which, it is
hoped, may long stand unparalleled.</p>

Says All Passengers Might Have been Saved but for
Captain Lord’s Indifference.</h2>

<h3>TITANIC COMMITTEE’S REPORT.</h3>

<div class="blockquott"><p>That the Titanic was rushing at a speed of 24½ miles an hour
when she crashed into the iceberg.</p>

<p>That of 2223 persons aboard, only 32 per cent. were saved.</p>

<p>That all might have been saved but for “negligent indifference”
of the steamship Californian to the Titanic’s distress
signals.</p>

<p>That those rescued comprised: Sixty per cent. of the first-class
passengers, 42 per cent. of second-class, 25 per cent. of
third-class and 24 per cent. of the crew.</p>

<p>That four warnings of “ice ahead” were ignored by the
Titanic’s officers.</p>

<p>That the Titanic struck at 10.13 P. M. on Sunday, April 14,
and sank at 12.47 A. M. (New York time) on April 15.</p>

<p>That eight vessels were near at time of the collision with
the iceberg and only the Carpathia went to the assistance of
the Titanic.</p>

<p>That there was no panic, but a “short” crew, poorly drilled
and poorly commanded, only enough men to partially man the
twenty lifeboats.</p></div>

<p>Teeming with eloquence, combining praise for heroism and
scathing rebuke for negligence and cowardice in the most appalling
marine tragedy of history, was the final and official requiem on May
28 in the Senate for the victims of the Titanic. Senator Smith, of
Michigan, chairman of the Senate Investigating Committee, summed
up his views of the evidence developed.</p>

<p>That every soul aboard the giant liner might have been saved
but for the indifference, inattention and almost criminal neglect of
Captain Stanley Lord and the other officers of the Californian was
the most startling charge Smith bitterly made.</p>

<p>“Needless sacrifice” of at least five hundred lives because the
“strangely insufficient number of life boats” were not filled was also
charged.</p>

<p>“Obsolete and antiquated shipping laws” and “laxity of regulation
and hasty inspection” by the British Board of Trade were
denounced by Smith. As a contributory cause he named the indifference
of Captain Smith, of the Titanic, for ignoring ice warnings
and forcing the Titanic full speed through the northern waters.
That Captain Smith had expiated his offense by a heroic
death was Smith’s tribute to the dead commander.</p>

<h3>LACK OF DISCIPLINE ARRAIGNED.</h3>

<p>Lack of discipline among the crew and cowardice of some of
its members indicated after the crash was scathingly arraigned. To
the two Titanic wireless operators&mdash;Phillips and Bride&mdash;the speaker
paid a glowing tribute. He lauded Captain Rostrom, of the rescue
ship, Carpathia.</p>

<p>In eloquent terms the chairman, Senator Smith, depicted the
folly of sending out the greatest ship afloat without sufficiently testing
a strange crew and with no drills or discipline. The Titanic, he
said, was following the proper course, although one known to be
dangerous at that season, but the speed was gradually and continually
increased until the maximum was the death-blow.</p>

<p>Rebuke for those in half-filled lifeboats who “stood by” and refused
aid to struggling, drowning swimmers until “all the noise had
ceased” was voiced.</p>

<p>“Upon that broken hull,” the Senator concluded, “new vows
were taken, new fealty expressed, old love renewed, and those who
had been devoted in life went proudly and defiantly on the last life
pilgrimage together. In such a heritage we must feel ourselves
more intimately related to the sea than ever before, and henceforth
it will send back to us on its rising tide the cheerful salutations from
those we have lost.</p>

<p>“At 10 o’clock on that fateful Sunday evening this latest maritime
creation was cutting its first pathway through the North Atlantic
Ocean with scarcely a ripple to retard its progress.</p>

<p>“From the builders’ hands she was plunged straightway to her
fate and christening salvos acclaimed at once her birth and death.
Builders of renown had launched her on the billows with confident
assurance of her strength, while every port rang with praise for
their achievement; shipbuilding to them was both a science and a religion;
parent ships and sister ships had easily withstood the waves,
while the mark of their hammer was all that was needed to give
assurance of the high quality of the work.</p>

<p>“In the construction of the Titanic no limit of cost circumscribed
their endeavor, and when this vessel took its place at the
head of the line every modern improvement in shipbuilding was
supposed to have been realized; so confident were they that both
owner and builder were eager to go upon the trial trip; no sufficient
tests were made of boilers or bulkheads or gearing or equipment,
and no life-saving or signal devices were reviewed; officers and crew
were strangers to one another and passengers to both.</p>

<h3>PASSENGERS AND CREW STUPEFIED.</h3>

<p>“Neither was familiar with the vessel or its implements or
tools; no drill or station practice or helpful discipline disturbed the
tranquillity of that voyage, and when the crisis came a state of absolute
unpreparedness stupefied both passengers and crew and, in their
despair, the ship went down, carrying as needless a sacrifice of noble
women and brave men as ever clustered about the judgment seat in
any single moment of passing time.</p>

<p>“We shall leave to the honest judgment of England its painstaking
chastisement of the British Board of Trade, to whose laxity
of regulation and hasty inspection the world is largely indebted for
this awful fatality. Of contributing causes there were very many.
In the face of warning signals, speed was increased and messages
of danger seemed to stimulate her to action rather than to persuade
her to fear.</p>

<p>“Captain Smith knew the sea and his clear eye and steady hand
had often guided his ship through dangerous paths. For forty
years storms sought in vain to vex him or menace his craft. But
once before in all his honorable career was his pride humbled or
his vessel maimed. Each new advancing type of ship built by his
company was handed over to him as a reward for faithful service
and as an evidence of confidence in his skill.</p>

<p>“Strong of limb, intent of purpose, pure in character, dauntless
as a sailor should be, he walked the deck of this majestic structure
as master of her keel, titanic though she was. His indifference
to danger was one of the direct and contributing causes of this unnecessary
tragedy, while his own willingness to die was the expiating
evidence of his fitness to live.</p>

<h3>OVERCONFIDENCE AND NEGLECT.</h3>

<p>“Those of us who knew him well&mdash;not in anger, but in sorrow&mdash;file
one specific charge against him, overconfidence and neglect to
heed the oft-repeated warnings of his friends; but, in his horrible
dismay, when his brain was afire with honest retribution, we can
still see, in his manly bearing and his tender solicitude for the safety
of women and little children, some traces of his lofty spirit when
dark clouds lowered all about him and angry elements stripped him
of his command.</p>

<p>“His devotion to his craft, even as it writhed and twisted and
struggled for mastery over its foe, calmed the fears of many of the
stricken multitude who hung upon his words, lending dignity to a
parting scene as inspiring as it is beautiful to remember.</p>

<p>“Life belts were finally adjusted and the lifeboats were cleared
away, and, although strangely insufficient in number, were only partially
loaded, and in instances unprovided with compasses and only
three of them had lamps. They were manned so badly that, in the
absence of prompt relief, they would have fallen easy victims to the
advancing ice floe, nearly thirty miles in width and rising sixteen
feet above the surface of the water.</p>

<p>“Their danger would have been as great as if they had remained
on the deck of the broken hull, and if the sea had risen these
toy targets, with over 700 exhausted people, would have been helplessly
tossed about upon the waves without food or water. The lifeboats
were filled so indifferently and lowered so quickly that, according
to the uncontradicted evidence, nearly 500 persons were
needlessly sacrificed to want of orderly discipline in loading the few
that were provided.</p>

<p>“The lifeboats would have easily cared for 1,176, and only contained
704, 12 of whom were taken into the boats from the water,
while the weather conditions were favorable and the sea perfectly
calm. And yet it is said by some well-meaning persons that the
best of discipline prevailed. If this is discipline, what would have
been disorder?</p>

<p>“Among the passengers were many strong men who had been
accustomed to command, whose lives had marked every avenue of
endeavor, and whose business experience and military training especially
fitted them for such an emergency.</p>

<h3>MEN RUDELY SILENCED.</h3>

<p>“These men were rudely silenced and forbidden to speak, as
was the president of the company, by junior officers, a few of whom,
I regret to say, availed themselves of the first opportunity to leave
the ship. Some of the men to whom had been intrusted the care of
passengers never reported to their official stations, and quickly deserted
the ship with a recklessness and indifference to the responsibilities
of their positions as culpable and amazing as it is impossible
to believe.</p>

<p>“And some of these men say that they ‘laid by’ in their partially
filled lifeboats and listened to the cries of distress ‘until the noise
quieted down’ and surveyed from a safe distance the unselfish men
and women and faithful fellow-officers and seamen, whose heroism
lightens up this tragedy and recalls the noblest traditions of the sea.</p>

<p>“Some things are dearer than life itself, and the refusal of
Phillips and Bride, wireless operators, to desert their posts of duty,
even after the water had mounted to the upper deck, because the
captain had not given them permission to leave, is an example of
faithfulness worthy of the highest praise, while the final exit of
the Phillips boy from the ship and from the world was not so swift
as to prevent him from pausing long enough to pass a cup of water
to a fainting woman, who fell from her husband’s arm into the operator’s
chair, as he was tardily fleeing from his wireless apparatus,
where he had ticked off the last message from his ship and from his
brain.</p>

<p>“It is no excuse that the apparatus on the Carpathia was antiquated;
it easily caught the signal of distress and spoke with other
ships nearly 200 miles away, both before and after the accident,
while the operator says it was good for 250 miles. The steamship
Californian was within easy reach of this ship for nearly four hours
after all the facts were known to Operator Cottam.</p>

<p>“The captain of the Carpathia says he gave explicit directions
that all official messages should be immediately sent through
other ships, and messages of passengers should be given preference.
According to Binns, the inspector, the apparatus on the Californian
was practically new and easily tuned to carry every detail of that
calamity to the coast stations at Cape Sable and Cape Race, and
should have done so.”</p>

<h3>CRITICISM FOR CAPTAIN LORD.</h3>

<p>Regarding the part played after the disaster by Captain Lord,
of the steamship Californian, Senator Smith declares that, while it
is not a pleasant duty to criticize the conduct of others, the plain
truth should be told. Referring to the testimony of repeated signals
given from the Californian with Morse lights, he declared:</p>

<p>“Most of the witnesses of the ill-fated vessel before the committee
saw plainly the light, which Captain Lord says was displayed
for nearly two hours after the accident, while the captain and
some of the officers of the Titanic directed the lifeboats to pull for
that light and return with the empty boats to the side of the ship.</p>

<p>“Why did the Californian display its Morse signal lamp from
the moment of the collision continuously for nearly two hours if
they saw nothing? And the signals which were visible to Mr. Gill
at 12.30 o’clock and afterward, and which were also seen by the
captain and officer of the watch, should have excited more solicitude
than was displayed by the officers of that vessel, and the failure
of Captain Lord to arouse the wireless operator on his ship,
who could have easily ascertained the name of the vessel in distress,
and reached her in time to avert loss of life, places a tremendous
responsibility upon this officer from which it will be very difficult
for him to escape.</p>

<p>“Had he been as vigilant in the movement of his vessel as he
was active in displaying his own signal lamp, there is a very strong
probability that every human life that was sacrificed through this
disaster could have been saved. The dictates of humanity should
have prompted vigilance under such conditions, and the law of
Great Britain, giving effect to Article II of the Brussels convention
in regard to assistance and salvage at sea, is as follows:</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>The master or person in charge of a vessel shall, so far as he
can do so without serious danger to his own vessel, her crew and
her passengers (if any), render assistance to every person, even if
such person be a subject of a foreign state at war with his Majesty,
who is found at sea in danger of being lost, and if he fails to do so,
he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.’</p>

<h3>PRAISE FOR CAPTAIN OF CARPATHIA.</h3>

<p>“The Senate passed on the 18th day of April last a bill giving
effect to the same treaty, which clearly indicates the disposition of
the Government of England, and our own as well, in matters of this
character. Contrast, if you will, the conduct of the captain of the
Carpathia in this emergency and imagine what must be the consolation
of that thoughtful and sympathetic mariner, who rescued
the shipwrecked and left the people of the world his debtor as his
ship sailed for distant seas a few days ago.</p>

<p>“By his utter self-effacement and his own indifference to peril,
by his promptness and his knightly sympathy, he rendered a great
service to humanity. He should be made to realize the debt of
gratitude this nation owes to him, while the book of good deeds,
which had so often been familiar with his unaffected valor, should
henceforth carry the name of Captain Rostrom to the remotest period
of time.</p>

<p>“With most touching detail he promptly ordered the ship’s officers
to their stations, distributed the doctors into positions of the
greatest usefulness, prepared comforts for man and mother and
babe; with foresight and tenderness he lifted them from their watery
imprisonment and, when the rescue had been completed, summoned
all of the rescued together and ordered the ship’s bell tolled
for the lost, and asked that prayers of thankfulness be offered by
those who had been spared. It falls to the lot of few men to perform
a service so unselfish, and the American Congress can honor
itself no more by any single act than by writing into its laws the
gratitude we feel toward this modest and kindly man.</p>

<p>“The lessons of this hour are, indeed, fruitless and its precepts
ill-conceived if rules of action do not follow hard upon the day
of reckoning. Obsolete and antiquated shipping laws should no
longer encumber the parliamentary records of any government, and
over-ripe administrative boards should be pruned of dead branches
and less sterile precepts taught and applied.”</p>
